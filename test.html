   Preface
   </h1>
   <p>
   While Louis D. Brandeis's series of articles on the money trust was running in Harper's Weekly many inquiries came about publication in more accessible permanent form. Even without such urgence througbh the mail, however, it would have been clear that these articles inevitably constituted a book, since they embodied an analysis and a narrative by that mind which, on the great industrial movements of our era, is the most expert in the United States. The inquiries meant that the attentive public recognized that here was a contribution to history. Here was the clearest and most profound treatment ever published on that part of our business development which, as President Wilson and other wise men have said, has come to constitute the greatest of our problems. The story of our time is the story of industry. No scholar of the future will be able to describe our era with authority unless he comprehends that expansion and concentration which followed the harnessing of steam and electricity, the great uses of the change, and the great excesses. No historian of the future, in my opinion, will find among our contemporary documents so masterful an analysis of why concentration went astray. I am but one among many who look upon Mr. Brandeis as having ,in the gield of economics, the most inventive and sound mind of our time. While his articles were running in Harper's Weekly I had ample opportunity to know how widespread was the belief among intelligent men that this brilliant diagnosis of our money trust was the most important contribution to current thought in many years.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Great" is one of the words that I do not use loosely, and I look upon Mr. Brandeis as a great man. In the composition of his intellect, one of the most important elements is his comprehension of figures. As one of the leading financiers of the country said to me, "Mr. Brandeis's greatness as a lawyer is part of his greatness as a mathematician." My views on this subject are sufficiently indicated in the follwing editorial in Harper's Weekly.
   </p>
   <p>
   Arithmetic
   </p>
   <p>
   About five years before the Metropolitan Traction Company of New York went into the hands of receiver, Mr. Brandeis came down from Boston, and in a speech at Cooper Union prophesied that that company must fail. Leading bankers in New York and Boston were heartily recommending the stock to their customers. Mr. Braneis made his prophecy merely by analyzing the published figures. How did he win in the Pinchot-Glavis-Ballinger controversy? In various ways, no doubt; but perhaps the most critical step was when he calculated just how long it would take a fast worker to go through the Glavis-Ballinger record and make a juegment of it; whereupon he decided that Mr. Wickersham could not have made his report at the tiem it was stated to have been made, and therefore it must have been predated.
   </p>
   <p>
   Most of Mr. Brandiers's other contributions to current history have involved arithmetic. when he succeeded in preventing a raise in freight rates, it was throught an exact analysis of cost. When he got Savings Bank Insurance started in Massachusees, it was by being abel to figure what insurance ought to cost. When he made the best contract between a city and a public utility that exists in this country, a definite grasp of the gas business was nescessary--combined, of course, with the wisdom and originality that make a statesman. He could not have invented the preferential shop if that new idea had not been founded on a precise knowledge of the conditions in the garment trades. When he established before the United States Supreme Court the constitutionality of legislation affedting women only, he relied much less upon reason than upon the amount of knowledge displayed of what actually happens to women when they are overworked--which, while not arithmetric, is built on the same intellectual quality. Nearly two years before Mr. Mellen resigned from the New Haven Railroad, Mr. Brandeis Wrote to the present Editor of this paper a private letter in which he said:
   </p>
   <p>
   "When the New Haven reduces its dividends and Mellen resigns, the 'Decline of New Haven and Fall of Mellen' will make a dramatic story of human interst with a moral--or two--including the evils of provate monopoly. Events can not be long deferred, and possibly you may want to prepare for their coming.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Anticipating the future a little, I suggest the following as an epitaph or obituary notice:
   </p>
   <p>
   "Mellen was a masterful man, resoreceful, courageous, broad of view. He fired the imagination of New England; but, being oblique of vision, merely distored its judgment and silenced its conscience. For a while he trampled with impunity on laws human and divine; but, as he was obsessed with the delusion that two and two make five, he fell, at last, a victim to the relentless rules of humble arithmetric.
   </p>
   <p>
   "'Remenber, O Stranger, Arithmetic is the first of the sciences and the mother of safety.'"
   </p>
   <p>
   The exposure of the bad financial management of the New Haven railroad, more than any other one thing, led to the exposure and comprehension of the wasteful methods of big business  all over the country and that exposure of the New Haven was the almost single-handed work of Mr. Brandeis. He is a person who fights against any odds while it is necessary to fight and stops fighting as soon as the fight is won. For a long time veyry respectable and honest leaders of finance said that his charges against the New Haven were unsound and inexcusable. He kept ahead. A year before the actual crash came, however, he ceased worrying,for he knew the wrk had been carried far enoughto complete itself. When someone asked him to take part in some little controversy shortly before the collapse, he replied, "That fight does not need me any longer. Time and arithmetic will do the rest.”
   </p>
   <p>
   This grasp of the concrete is combined in Mr. Brandeis with an equally distinguished grasp of bearing and significance. His imagination is as notable as his understanding of business. In those accomplishments which have given him his place in American life, the two sides of his mind have worked together. The arrangement between the Gas Company and the City of Boston rests on one of the guiding principles of Mr. Brandeis’s life, that no contract is good that is not advantageous to both parties to it. Behind his understanding of the methods of obtaining insurance and the proper post of it to the laboring man lay a philosophy of the vast advantage to the fibre and energy of the community that would come from devising methods by which the laboring classes could make themselves comfortable through their whole lives and thus perhaps making unnecessary elaborate systems of state help. The most important ideas put forth in the Armstrong Committee Report on insurance had been previously suggested by Mr. Brandeis, acting as counsel for the Equitable policy holders. Business and the more important statesmanship were intimately combined in the management of the Protocol in New York, which has done so much to improve conditions in the clothing industry. The welfare of the laborer and his relation to his employer seems to Mr. Brandeis, as it does to all the most competent thinkers today, to constitute the most important question we have to solve, and he won the case, coming up to the Supreme Court of the United States, from Oregon, establishing the constitutionality of special protective legislation for women. In the Minimum Wage case, also from the State of Oregon, which is about to be heard before the Supreme Court, he takes up what is really a logical sequence of the limitation of women’s hours in certain industries, since it would be a futile performance to limit their hours and then allow their wages to be cut down in consequence. These industrial activities are in large part an expression of his deep and ever growing sympathy with the working people and understanding of them. Florence Kelley once said: “No man since Lincoln has understood the common people as Louis Brandeis does.”
   </p>
   <p>
   While the majority of Mr. Brandeis’s great progressive achievements have been connected with the industrial system, some have been political in a more limited sense. I worked with him through the Ballinger-Pinchot controversy, and I never saw a grasp of detail more brilliantly combined with high constructive ethical and political thinking. After the man who knew most about the details of the Interior Department had been cross-examined by Mr. Brandeis he came and sat down by me and said: “Mr. Hapgood, I have no respect for you. I do not think your motives in this agitation are good motives, but I want to say that you have a wonderful lawyer. He knows as much about the Interior Department today as I do.” In that controversy, the power of the administration and of the ruling forces in the House and Senate were combined to protect Secretary Ballinger and prevent the truth from coming to light. Mr. Brandeis, in leading the fight or the conservation side, was constantly haunted by the idea that there was a mystery somewhere. The editorial printed above hints as how he solved the mystery, but it would require much more space to tell the other sides, the enthusiasm for conservation, the convincing arguments for higher standards in office, the connection of this conspiracy with the country’s larger needs. Seldom is an audience at a hearing so moved as it was by Mr. Brandeis’s final plea to the committee.
   </p>
   <p>
   Possibly his work on railroads will turn out to be the most significant among the many things Mr. Brandeis has done. His arguments in 1910-11 before the Interstate Commerce Commission against the raising of rates, on the ground that the way for railroads to be more prosperous was to be more efficient, made efficiency a national idea. It is a cardinal point in his philosophy that the only real progress toward a higher national life will come through efficiency in all our activities. The seventy-eight questions addressed to the railroads by the Interstate Commerce Commission in December, 1913, embody what is probably the most comprehensive embodiment of his thought on the subject.
   </p>
   <p>
   On nothing has he ever worked harder than on his diagnosis of the Money Trust, and when his life comes to be written (I hope many years hence) this will be ranked with his railroad work for its effect in accelerating industrial changes. It is indeed more than a coincidence that so many of the thins he has been contending for have come to pass. It is seldom that one man puts one idea, not to say many ideas, effectively before the world, but it is no exaggeration to say that Mr. Brandeis is responsible for the now wide-spread recognition of the inherent weakness of great size. He was the first person who set forth effectively the doctrine that there is a limit to the size of greatest efficiency, and the successful demonstration of that truth is a profound contribution to the subject of trusts. The demonstration is powerfully put in his testimony before the Senate Committee in 1911, and it is powerfully put in this volume. In destroying the delusion that efficiency was a common incident of size, he emphasized the possibility of efficiency through intensive development of the individual, thus connecting this principle with his whole study of efficiency, and pointing the way to industrial democracy.
   </p>
   <p>
   Not less notable than the intellect and the constructive ability that have gone into Mr. Brandeis’s work are the exceptional moral qualities. Any powerful and entirely sincere crusader must sacrifice much. Mr. Brandeis has sacrificed much in money, in agreeableness of social life, in effort, and he has done it for principle and for human happiness. His power of intensive work, his sustained interest and will, and his courage have been necessary for leadership. No man could have done waht he has done without being willing to devote his life to making his dreams come true.
   </p>
   <p>
   Nor should anyone make the mistake, because the labors of Mr. Brandeis and others have recently brought about changes, that the system which was being attacked has been undermined. The currency bill has been passed, and as these words are written, it looks as if a group of trust bills would be passed. But systems are not ended in a day. Of the truths which are embodied in the essays printed in this book, some are being carried out now, but it will be many, many years before the whole idea can be made effective; and there will, therefore, be many, many years during which active citizens will be struggling for those principles which are here so clearly, so eloquently, so conclusively set forth.

   Chapter I: Our Financial Oligarchy
   </h1>
   <p>
   PRESIDENT WILSON, when Governor, declared in 1911:
   </p>
   <p>
   "The great monopoly in this country is the money monopoly. So long as that exists, our old variety and freedom and individual energy of development are out of the question. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men, who, even if their actions be honest and intended for the public interest, are necessarily concentrated upon the great undertakings in which their own money is involved and who, necessarily, by every reason of their own limitations, chill and check and destroy genuine economic freedom. This is the greatest question of all; and to this, statesmen must address themselves with an earnest determination to serve the long future and the true liberties of men.”
   </p>
   <p>
   The Pujo Committee--appointed in 1912—found:
   </p>
   <p>
   "Far more dangerous than all that has happened to us in the past in the way of elimination of competition in industry is the control of credit through the domination of these groups over our banks and industries."…
   </p>
   <p>
   "Whether under a different currency system the resources in our banks would be greater or less is comparatively immaterial if they continue to be controlled by a small group."…
   </p>
   <p>
   "It is impossible that there should be competition with all the facilities for raising money or selling large issues of bonds in the hands of these few bankers and their partners and allies, who together dominate the financial policies of most of the existing systems. . . . The acts of this inner group, as here described, have nevertheless been more destructive of competition than anything accomplished by the trusts, for they strike at the very vitals of potential competition in every industry that is under their protection, a condition which if permitted to continue, will render impossible all attempts to restore normal competitive conditions in the industrial world. . . .
   </p>
   <p>
   "If the arteries of credit now clogged well-nigh to choking by the obstructions created through the control of these groups are opened so that they may be permitted freely to play their important part in the financial system, competition in large enterprises will become possible and business can be conducted on its merits instead of being subject to the tribute and the good will of this handful of self-constituted trustees of the national prosperity.”
   </p>
   <p>
   The promise of New Freedom was joyously proclaimed in 1913.
   </p>
   <p>
   The facts which the Pujo Investigating Committee and its able Counsel, Mr. Samuel Untermyer, have laid before the country, show clearly the means by which a few men control the business of America. The report proposes measures which promise some relief. Additional remedies will be proposed. Congress will soon be called upon to act.
   </p>
   <p>
   How shall the emancipation be wrought? On what lines shall we proceed? The facts, when fully understood, will teach us.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Dominant Element
   </h2>
   <p>
   The dominant element in our financial oligarchy is the investment banker. Associated banks, trust companies and life insurance companies are his tools. Controlled railroads, public service and industrial corporations are his subjects. Though properly but middlemen, these bankers bestride as masters America's business world, so that practically no large enterprise can be undertaken successfully without their participation or approval. These bankers are, of course, able men possessed of large fortunes; but the most potent factor in their control of business is not the possession of extraordinary ability or huge wealth. The key to their power is Combination--concentration intensive and comprehensive--advancing on three distinct lines:
   </p>
   <p>
   First: There is the obvious consolidation of banks and trust companies; the less obvious affiliations--through stockholdings, voting trusts and interlocking directorates--of banking institutions which are not legally connected; and the joint transactions, gentlemen's agreements, and "banking ethics" which eliminate competition among the investment bankers.
   </p>
   <p>
   Second: There is the consolidation of railroads into huge systems, the large combinations of public service corporations and the formation of industrial trusts, which, by making businesses so "big" that local, independent banking concerns cannot alone supply the necessary funds, has created dependence upon the associated New York bankers.
   </p>
   <p>
   But combination, however intensive, along these lines only, could not have produced the Money Trust--another and more potent factor of combination was added.
   </p>
   <p>
   Third: Investment bankers, like J. P. Morgan & Co., dealers in bonds, stocks and notes, encroached upon the functions of the three other classes of corporations with which their business brought them into contact. They became the directing power in railroads, public service and industrial companies through which our great business operations are conducted-the makers of bonds and stocks. They became the directing power in the life insurance companies, and other corporate reservoirs of the people's savings-the buyers of bonds and stocks. They became the directing power also in banks and trust companies--the depositaries of the quick capital of the country--the life blood of business, with which they and others carried on their operations. Thus four distinct functions, each essential to business, and each exercised, originally, by a distinct set of men, became united in the investment banker. It is to this union of business functions that the existence of the Money Trust is mainly due. (Obviously only a few of the investment bankers exercise this great power; but many others perform important functions in the system, as hereinafter described.)
   </p>
   <p>
   The development of our financial oligarchy followed, in this respect, lines with which the history of political despotism has familiarized us: --usurpation, proceeding by gradual encroachment rather than by violent acts; subtle and often long-concealed concentration of distinct functions, which are beneficent when separately administered, and dangerous only when combined in the same persons. It was by processes such as these that Caesar Augustus became master of Rome. The makers of our own Constitution had in mind like dangers to our political liberty when they provided so carefully for the separation of governmental powers.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Proper Sphere of the Investment Banker
   </h2>
   <p>
   The original function of the investment banker was that of dealer in bonds, stocks and notes; buying mainly at wholesale from corporations, municipalities, states and governments which need money, and selling to those seeking investments. The banker performs, in this respect, the function of a merchant; and the function is a very useful one. Large business enterprises are conducted generally by corporations. The permanent capital of corporations is represented by bonds and stocks. The bonds and stocks of the more important corporations are owned, in large part, by small investors, who do not participate in the management of the company. Corporations require the aid of a banker-middleman, for they lack generally the reputation and clientele essential to selling their own bonds and stocks direct to the investor. Investors in corporate securities, also, require the services of a banker-middleman. The number of securities upon the market is very large. Only a part of these securities is listed on the New York Stock Exchange; but its listings alone comprise about sixteen hundred different issues aggregating about $26,500,000,000, and each year new listings are made averaging about two hundred and thirty-three to an amount of $1,500,000,000. For a small investor to make an intelligent selection from these many corporate securities--indeed, to pass an intelligent judgment upon a single one--is ordinarily impossible. He lacks the ability, the facilities, the training and the time essential to a proper investigation. Unless his purchase is to be little better than a gamble, he needs the advice of an expert, who, combining special knowledge with judgment, has the facilities and incentive to make a thorough investigation. This dependence, both of corporations and of investors, upon the banker has grown in recent years, since women and others who do not participate in the management, have become the owners of so large a part of the stocks and bonds of our great corporations. Over half of the stockholders of the American Sugar Refining Company and nearly half of the stockholders of the Pennsylvania Railroad and of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad are women.
   </p>
   <p>
   Good-will--the possession by a dealer of numerous and valuable regular customers--is always an important element in merchandising. But in the business of selling bonds and stocks, it is of exceptional value, for the very reason that the small investor relies so largely upon the banker's judgment. This confidential relation of the banker to customers--and the knowledge of the customers' private affairs acquired incidentally--is often a determining factor in the marketing of securities. With the advent of Big Business such good-will possessed by the older banking houses, preeminently J. P. Morgan & Co. and their Philadelphia House called Drexel & Co., by Lee, Higginson & Co. and Kidder, Peabody, & Co. of Boston, and by Kuhn, Loeb & Co. of New York, became of enhanced importance. The volume of new security issues was greatly increased by huge railroad consolidations, the development of the holding companies, and particularly by the formation of industrial trusts. The rapidly accumulating savings of our people sought investment. The field of operations for the dealer in securities was thus much enlarged. And, as the securities were new and untried, the services of the investment banker were in great demand, and his powers and profits increased accordingly.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Controlling the Security Makers
   </h2>
   <p>
   But this enlargement of their legitimate field of operations did not satisfy investment bankers. They were not content merely to deal in securities. They desired to manufacture them also. They became promoters, or allied themselves with promoters. Thus it was that J. P. Morgan & Company formed the Steel Trust, the Harvester Trust and the Shipping Trust. And, adding the duties of undertaker to those of midwife, the investment bankers became, in times of corporate disaster, members of security-holders' "Protective Committees"; then they participated as "Reorganization Managers" in the reincarnation of the unsuccessful corporations and ultimately became directors. It was in this way that the Morgan associates acquired their hold upon the Southern Railway, the Northern Pacific, the Reading, the Erie, the Père Marquette, the Chicago and Great Western, and the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton. Often they insured the continuance of such control by the device of the voting trust; but even where no voting trust was created, a secure hold was acquired upon reorganization. It was in this way also that Kuhn, Loeb & Co. became potent in the Union Pacific and in the Baltimore & Ohio.
   </p>
   <p>
   But the banker's participation in the management of corporations was not limited to cases of promotion or reorganization. An urgent or extensive need of new money was considered a sufficient reason for the banker's entering a board of directors. Often without even such excuse the investment banker has secured a place upon the Board of Directors, through his powerful influence or the control of his customers' proxies. Such seems to have been the fatal entrance of Mr. Morgan into the management of the then prosperous New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad, in 1892. When once a banker has entered the Board--whatever may have been the occasion--his grip proves tenacious and his influence usually supreme; for he controls the supply of new money.
   </p>
   <p>
   The investment banker is naturally on the lookout for good bargains in bonds and stocks. Like other merchants he wants to buy his merchandise cheap. But when he becomes director of a corporation, he occupies a position which prevents the transaction by which he acquires its corporate securities from being properly called a bargain. Can there be real bargaining where the same man is on both sides of a trade? The investment banker, through his controlling influence on the Board of Directors, decides that the corporation shall issue and sell the securities, decides the price at which it shall sell them, and decides that it shall sell the securities to himself. The fact that there are other directors besides the banker on the Board does not, in practice, prevent this being the result. The banker, who holds the purse-strings, becomes usually the dominant spirit. Through voting-trusteeships, exclusive financial agencies, membership on executive or finance committees, or by mere directorships, J. P. Morgan & Co., and their associates, held such financial power in at least thirty-two transportation systems, public utility corporations and industrial companies--companies with an aggregate capitalization of $17,273,000,000. Mainly for corporations so controlled, J. P. Morgan & Co. procured the public marketing in ten years of security issues aggregating $1,950,000,000. This huge sum does not include any issues marketed privately, nor any issues, however marketed, of intra-state corporations. Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and a few other investment bankers exercise similar control over many other corporations.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Controlling Security Buyers
   </h2>
   <p>
   Such control of railroads, public service and industrial corporations assures to the investment bankers an ample supply of securities at attractive prices; and merchandise well bought is half sold. But these bond and stock merchants are not disposed to take even a slight risk as to their ability to market their goods. They saw that if they could control the security buyers, as well as the security-makers, investment banking would, indeed, be "a happy hunting ground"; and they have made it so.
   </p>
   <p>
   The numerous small investors cannot, in the strict sense, be controlled; but their dependence upon the banker insures their being duly influenced. A large part, however, of all bonds issued and of many stocks are bought by the prominent corporate investors; and most prominent among these are the life insurance companies, the trust companies, and the banks. The purchase of a security by these institutions not only relieves the banker of the merchandise, but recommends it strongly to the small investor, who believes that these institutions are wisely managed. These controlled corporate investors are not only large customers, but may be particularly accommodating ones. Individual investors are moody. They buy only when they want to do so. They are sometimes inconveniently reluctant. Corporate investors, if controlled, may be made to buy when the bankers need a market. It was natural that the investment bankers proceeded to get control of the great life insurance companies, as well as of the trust companies and the banks.
   </p>
   <p>
   The field thus occupied is uncommonly rich. The life insurance companies are our leading institutions for savings. Their huge surplus and reserves, augmented daily, are always clamoring for investment. No panic or money shortage stops the inflow of new money from the perennial stream of premiums on existing policies and interest on existing investments. The three great companies-the New York Life, the Mutual of New York, and the Equitable-would have over $55,000,000 of new money to invest annually, even if they did not issue a single new policy. In 1904--just before the Armstrong investigation--these three companies had together $1,247,331,738.18 of assets. They had issued in that year $1,025,671,126 of new policies. The New York legislature placed in 1906 certain restrictions upon their growth; so that their new business since has averaged $547,384,212, or only fifty-three per cent. of what it was in 1904. But the aggregate assets of these companies increased in the last eight years to $1,817,052,260.36. At the time of the Armstrong investigation the average age of these three companies was fifty-six years. The growth of assets in the last eight years was about half as large as the total growth in the preceding fifty-six years. These three companies must invest annually about $70,000,000 of new money; and besides, many old investments expire or are changed and the proceeds must be reinvested. A large part of all life insurance surplus and reserves are invested in bonds. The aggregate bond investments of these three companies on January 1, 1913, was $1,019,153,268.93.
   </p>
   <p>
   It was natural that the investment bankers should seek to control these never-failing reservoirs of capital. George W. Perkins was Vice-President of the New York Life, the largest of the companies. While remaining such he was made a partner in J. P. Morgan Co., and in the four years preceding the Armstrong investigation, his firm sold the New York Life $38,804,918.51 in securities. The New York Life is a mutual company, supposed to be controlled by its policy holders. But as the Pujo Committee finds "the so-called control of life insurance companies by policy-holders through mutualization is a farce" and "its only result is to keep in office a self-constituted, self-perpetuating management.”
   </p>
   <p>
   The Equitable Life Assurance Society is a stock company and is controlled by $100,000 of stock. The dividend on this stock is limited by law to seven per cent.; but in 1910 Mr. Morgan paid about $3,000,000 for $51,000, par value of this stock, or $5,882.35 a share. The dividend return on the stock investment is less than one-eighth of one per cent.; but the assets controlled amount now to over $500,000,000. And certain of these assets had an especial value for investment bankers;-namely, the large holdings of stock in banks and trust companies.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Armstrong investigation disclosed the extent of financial power exerted through the insurance company holdings of bank and trust company stock. The Committee recommended legislation compelling the insurance companies to dispose of the stock within five years. A law to that effect was enacted, but the time was later extended. The companies then disposed of a part of their bank and trust company stocks; but, as the insurance companies were controlled by the investment bankers, these gentlemen sold the bank and trust company stocks to themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
   Referring to such purchases from the Mutual Life, as well as from the Equitable, the Pujo Committee found:
   </p>
   <p>
   "Here, then, were stocks of five important trust companies and one of our largest national banks in New York City that had been held by these two life insurance companies. Within five years all of these stocks, so far as distributed by the insurance companies, have found their way into the hands of the men who virtually controlled or were identified with the management of the insurance companies or of their close allies and associates, to that extent thus further entrenching them.”
   </p>
   <p>
   The banks and trust companies are depositaries, in the main, not of the people's savings, but of the business man's quick capital. Yet, since the investment banker acquired control of banks and trust companies, these institutions also have become, like the life companies, large purchasers of bonds and stocks. Many of our national banks have invested in this manner a large part of all their resources, including capital, surplus and deposits. The bond investments of some banks exceed by far the aggregate of their capital and surplus, and nearly equal their loanable deposits.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Controlling Other People's Quick Capital
   </h2>
   <p>
   The goose that lays golden eggs has been considered a most valuable possession. But even more profitable is the privilege of taking the golden eggs laid by somebody else's goose. The investment bankers and their associates now enjoy that privilege. They control the people through the people's own money. If the bankers' power were commensurate only with their wealth, they would have relatively little influence on American business. Vast fortunes like those of the Astors are no doubt regrettable. They are inconsistent with democracy. They are unsocial. And they seem peculiarly unjust when they represent largely unearned increment. But the wealth of the Astors does not endanger political or industrial liberty. It is insignificant in amount as compared with the aggregate wealth of America, or even of New York City. It lacks significance largely because its owners have only the income from their own wealth. The Astor wealth is static. The wealth of the Morgan associates is dynamic. The power and the growth of power of our financial oligarchs comes from wielding the savings and quick capital of others. In two of the three great life insurance companies the influence of J. P. Morgan & Co. and their associates is exerted without any individual investment by them whatsoever. Even in the Equitable, where Mr. Morgan bought an actual majority of all the outstanding stock, his investment amounts to little more than one-half of one per cent. of the assets of the company. The fetters which bind the people are forged from the people's own gold.
   </p>
   <p>
   But the reservoir of other people's money, from which the investment bankers now draw their greatest power, is not the life insurance companies, but the banks and the trust companies. Bank deposits represent the really quick capital of the nation. They are the life blood of businesses. Their effective force is much greater than that of an equal amount of wealth permanently invested. The 34 banks and trust companies, which the Pujo Committee declared to be directly controlled by the Morgan associates, held $1,983,000,000 in deposits. Control of these institutions means the ability to lend a large part of these funds, directly and indirectly, to themselves; and what is often even more important, the power to prevent the funds being lent to any rival interests. These huge deposits can, in the discretion of those in control, be used to meet the temporary needs of their subject corporations. When bonds and stocks are issued to finance permanently these corporations, the bank deposits can, in large part, be loaned by the investment bankers in control to themselves and their associates; so that securities bought may be carried by them, until sold to investors. Or these bank deposits may be loaned to allied bankers, or jobbers in securities, or to speculators, to enable them to carry the bonds or stocks. Easy money tends to make securities rise in the market. Tight money nearly always makes them fall. The control by the leading investment bankers over the banks and trust companies is so great, that they can often determine, for a time, the market for money by lending or refusing to lend on the Stock Exchange. In this way, among others, they have power to affect the general trend of prices in bonds and stocks. Their power over a particular security is even greater. Its sale on the market may depend upon whether the security is favored or discriminated against when offered to the banks and trust companies, as collateral for loans.
   </p>
   <p>
   Furthermore, it is the investment banker's access to other people's money in controlled banks and trust companies which alone enables any individual banking concern to take so large part of the annual output of bonds and stocks. The banker's own capital, however large, would soon be exhausted. And even the loanable funds of the banks would often be exhausted, but for the large deposits made in those banks by the life insurance, railroad, public service, and industrial corporations which the bankers also control. On December 31, 1912, the three leading life insurance companies had deposits in banks and trust companies aggregating $13,839,189.08. As the Pujo Committee finds:
   </p>
   <p>
   "The men who through their control over the funds of our railroads and industrial companies are able to direct where such funds shall be kept and thus to create these great reservoirs of the people's money, are the ones who are in position to tap those reservoirs for the ventures in which they are interested and to prevent their being tapped for purposes of which they do not approve. The latter is quite as important a factor as the former. It is the controlling consideration in its effect on competition in the railroad and industrial world.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   Having Your Cake and Eating it Too
   </h2>
   <p>
   But the power of the investment banker over other people's money is often more direct and effective than that exerted through controlled banks and trust companies. J. P. Morgan & Co. achieve the supposedly impossible feat of having their cake and eating it too. They buy the bonds and stocks of controlled railroads and industrial concerns, and pay the purchase price; and still do not part with their money. This is accomplished by the simple device of becoming the bank of deposit of the controlled corporations, instead of having the company deposit in some merely controlled bank in whose operation others have at least some share. When J. P. Morgan & Co. buy an issue of securities the purchase money, instead of being paid over to the corporation, is retained by the banker for the corporation, to be drawn upon only as the funds are needed by the corporation. And as the securities are issued in large blocks, and the money raised is often not all spent until long thereafter, the aggregate of the balances remaining in the bankers' hands are huge. Thus J. P. Morgan & Co. (including their Philadelphia house, called Drexel & Co.) held on November 1, 1912, deposits aggregating $162,491,819.65.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Power and Pelf
   </h2>
   <p>
   The operations of so comprehensive a system of concentration necessarily developed in the bankers overweening power. And the bankers' power grows by what it feeds on. Power begets wealth; and added wealth opens ever new opportunities for the acquisition of wealth and power. The operations of these bankers are so vast and numerous that even a very reasonable compensation for the service performed by the bankers, would, in the aggregate, produce for them incomes so large as to result in huge accumulations of capital. But the compensation taken by the bankers as commissions or profits is often far from reasonable. Occupying, as they so frequently do, the inconsistent position of being at the same time seller and buyer, the standard for so-called compensation actually applied, is not the "Rule of reason", but "All the traffic will bear." And this is true even where there is no sinister motive. The weakness of human nature prevents men from being good judges of their own deservings.
   </p>
   <p>
   The syndicate formed by J. P. Morgan & Co. to underwrite the United States Steel Corporation took for its services securities which netted $62,500,000 in cash. Of this huge sum J. P. Morgan & Co. received, as syndicate managers, $12,500,000 in addition to the share which they were entitled to receive as syndicate members. This sum of $62,500,000 was only a part of the fees paid for the service of monopolizing the steel industry. In addition to the commissions taken specifically for organizing the United States Steel Corporation, large sums were paid for organizing the several companies of which it is composed. For instance, the National Tube Company was capitalized at $80,000,000 of stock; $40,000,000 of which was common stock. Half of this $44,000,000 was taken by J. P. Morgan & Co. and their associates for promotion services; and the $20,000,000 stock so taken became later exchangeable for $25,000,000 of Steel Common. Commissioner of Corporations Herbert Knox Smith found that:
   </p>
   <p>
   "More than $150,000,000 of the stock of the Steel Corporation was issued directly or indirectly (through exchange) for mere promotion or underwriting services. In other words, nearly one-seventh of the total capital stock of the Steel Corporation appears to have been issued directly or indirectly to promoters' services.”
   </p>
   <p>
   The so-called fees and commissions taken by the bankers and associates upon the organization of the trusts have been exceptionally large. But even after the trusts are successfully launched the exactions of the bankers are often extortionate. The syndicate which underwrote, in 1901, the Steel Corporation's preferred stock conversion plan, advanced only $20,000,000 in cash and received an underwriting commission of $6,800,000.
   </p>
   <p>
   The exaction of huge commissions is not confined to trust and other industrial concerns. The Interborough Railway is a most prosperous corporation. It earned last year nearly 21 per cent. on its capital stock, and secured from New York City, in connection with the subway extension, a very favorable contract. But when it financed its $170,000,000 bond issue it was agreed that J. P. Morgan & Co. should receive three per cent., that is, $5,100,000, for merely forming this syndicate. More recently, the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad agreed to pay J. P. Morgan & Co. a commission of $1,680,000; that is, 2 1/2 per cent., to form a syndicate to underwrite an issue at par of $67,000,000 20-year 6 per cent. convertible debentures. That means: The bankers bound themselves to take at 97 1/2 any of these six per cent. convertible bonds which stockholders might be unwilling to buy at 100. When the contract was made the New Haven's then outstanding six per cent. convertible bonds were selling at 114. And the new issue, as soon as announced, was in such demand that the public offered and was for months willing to buy at 106 bonds which the Company were to pay J. P. Morgan & Co. $1,680,000 to be willing to take at par.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Why the Banks Became Investment Bankers
   </h2>
   <p>
   These large profits from promotions, underwritings and security purchases led to a revolutionary change in the conduct of our leading banking institutions. It was obvious that control by the investment bankers of the deposits in banks and trust companies was an essential element in their securing these huge profits. And the bank officers naturally asked, "Why then should not the banks and trust companies share in so profitable a field? Why should not they themselves become investment bankers too, with all the new functions incident to `Big Business'?" To do so would involve a departure from the legitimate sphere of the banking business, which is the making of temporary loans to business concerns. But the temptation was irresistible. The invasion of the investment banker into the banks' field of operation was followed by a counter invasion by the banks into the realm of the investment banker. Most prominent among the banks were the National City and the First National of New York. But theirs was not a hostile invasion. The contending forces met as allies, joined forces to control the business of the country, and to "divide the spoils." The alliance was cemented by voting trusts, by interlocking directorates and by joint ownerships. There resulted the fullest "cooperation"; and ever more railroads, public service corporations, and industrial concerns were brought into complete subjection.
   </p>
   <h1>
   Chapter II: How the Combiners Combine
   </h1>
   <p>
   Among the allies, two New York banks—the National City and the First National—stand preeminent. They constitute, with the Morgan firm, the inner group of the Money Trust. Each of the two banks, like J. P. Morgan & Co., has huge resources. Each of the two banks, like the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co., has been dominated by a genius in combination. In the Na­tional City it is James Stillman; in the First National, George F. Baker. Each of these gentlemen was for­merly President, and is now Chairman of the Board of Directors. The resources of the National City Bank (including its Siamese-twin security company) are about $300,000,000; those of the First National Bank (including its Siamese-twin security company) are about $200,000,000. The resources of the Morgan firm have not been disclosed. But it appears that they have available for their operations, also, huge deposits from their subjects; deposits reported as $162,500,000.
   </p>
   <p>
   The private fortunes of the chief actors in the combination have not been ascertained. But sporadic evidence indicates how great are the possibilities of accumulation when one has the use of "other people's money." Mr. Morgan's wealth became proverbial. Of Mr. Stillman's many investments, only one was specifically referred to, as he was in Europe during the investigation, and did not testify. But that one is significant. His 47,498 shares in the National City Bank are worth about $18,000,000. Mr. Jacob H. Schiff aptly described this as "a very nice investment.”
   </p>
   <p>
   Of Mr. Baker's investments we know more, as he testified on many subjects. His 20,000 shares in the First National Bank are worth at least $20,000,000. His stocks in six other New York banks and trust companies are together worth about $3,000,000. The scale of his investment in railroads may be inferred from his former holdings in the Central Railroad of New Jersey. He was its largest stockholder—so large that with a few friends he held a majority of the $27,436,800 par value of outstanding stock, which the Reading bought at $160 a share. He is a director in 28 other railroad companies; and presumably a stock­holder in, at least, as many. The full extent of his fortune was not inquired into, for that was not an issue in the investigation. But it is not surprising that Mr. Baker saw little need of new laws. When asked:
   </p>
   <p>
   "You think everything is all right as it is in this world, do you not?”
   </p>
   <p>
   He answered, "Pretty nearly.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   Ramifications of Power
   </h2>
   <p>
   But wealth expressed in figures gives a wholly inadequate picture of the allies' power. Their wealth is dynamic. It is wielded by geniuses in combination. It finds its proper expression in means of control. To comprehend the power of the allies we must try to visualize the ramifications through which the forces operate.
   </p>
   <p>
   Mr. Baker is a director in 22 corporations having, with their many subsidiaries, aggregate resources or capitalization of $7,272,000,000. But the direct and visible power of the First National Bank, which Mr. Baker dominates, extends further. The Pujo report shows that its directors (including Mr. Baker's son) are directors in at least 27 other corporations with resources of $4,270,000,000. That is, the First National is represented in 49 corporations, with aggregate resources or capitalization of $11,542,000,000.
   </p>
   <p>
   It may help to an appreciation of the allies’ power to name a few of the more prominent corporations in which, for instance, Mr. Baker's influence is exerted—visibly and directly—as voting trustee, executive com­mittee man or simple director.
   </p>
   <p>
   1. Banks, Trust, and Life Insurance Companies:First National Bank of New York; National Bank of Commerce; Farmers' Loan and Trust Company; Mutual Life Insurance Company.
   </p>
   <p>
   2. Railroad Companies:New York Central Lines; New Haven, Reading, Erie, Lackawanna, Lehigh Valley, Southern, Northern Pacific, Chicago, Burlington & Quincy.
   </p>
   <p>
   3. Public Service Corporations:American Telegraph & Telephone Company, Adams Express Company.
   </p>
   <p>
   4. Industrial Corporations:United States Steel Corporation, Pullman Company.
   </p>
   <p>
   Mr. Stillman is a director in only 7 corporations, with aggregate assets of $2,476,000,000; but the directors in the National City Bank, which he dominates, are directors in at least 41 other corporations which, with their subsidiaries, have an aggregate capitalization or resources of $10,564,000,000. The members of the firm of J. P, Morgan & Co., the acknowledged leader of the allied forces, hold 72 directorships in 47 of the largest corporations of the country.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Pujo Committee finds that the members of J. P. Morgan & Co. and the directors of their controlled trust companies and of the First National and the National City Bank together hold:
   </p>
   <p>
   "One hundred and eighteen directorships in 34 banks and trust companies having total resources of $2,679,000,000 and total deposits of $1,983,000,000.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Thirty directorships in 10 insurance companies having total assets of $2,293,000,000.
   </p>
   <p>
   "One hundred and five directorships in 32 transportation systems having a total capitalization of $11,784,000,000 and a total mileage (excluding express companies and steamship lines) of 150,200.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Sixty-three directorships in 24 producing and trading corporations having a total capitalization of $3,339,000,000.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Twenty-five directorships in 12 public-utility corporations having a total capitalization of $2,150,000,000.
   </p>
   <p>
   "In all, 341 directorships in 112 corporations having aggregate resources or capitalization of $22,245,000,000”
   </p>
   <h2>
   Twenty-Two Billion Dollars
   </h2>
   <p>
   Twenty-two billion dollars is a large sum—so large that we have difficulty in grasping its significance. The mind realizes size only through comparisons. With what can we compare twenty-two billions of dollars? Twenty-two billions of dollars is more than three times the assessed value of all the property, real and personal, in all New England. It is nearly three times the assessed value of all the real estate in the City of New York. It is more than twice the assessed value of all the property in the thirteen Southern states. It is more than the assessed value of all the property in the twenty-two states, north and south, lying west of the Mississippi River.
   </p>
   <p>
   But the huge sum of twenty-two billion dollars is not large enough to include all the corporations to which the "influence" of the three allies, directly and visibly, extends, for
   </p>
   <p>
   First:There are 56 other corporations (not included in the Pujo schedule) each with capital or resources of over $5,000,000, and aggregating nearly $1,350,000,000, in which the Morgan allies are represented accord­ing to the directories of directors.
   </p>
   <p>
   Second:The Pujo schedule does not include any corporation with resources of less than $5,000,000. But these financial giants have shown their humility by becoming directors in many such. For instance, members of J. P. Morgan & Co., and directors in the National City Bank and the First National Bank are also directors in 158 such corporations. Available publications disclose the capitalization of only 38 of these, but those 38 aggregate $78,669,375.
   </p>
   <p>
   Third:The Pujo schedule includes only the corporations in which the Morgan associates actually appear by name as directors. It does not include those in which they are represented by dummies, or otherwise. For instance, the Morgan influence certainly extends to the Kansas City Terminal Railway Company, for which they have marketed since 1910 (in connection with others) four issues aggregating $41,761,000. But no member of J. P. Morgan & Co., of the National City Bank, or of the First National Bank appears on the Kansas City Terminal directorate.
   </p>
   <p>
   Fourth:The Pujo schedule does not include all the subsidiaries of the corporations scheduled. For instance, the capitalization of the New Haven System is given as $385,000,000. That sum represents the bond and stock capital of the New HavenRailroad. But the New HavenSystemcomprises many controlled corporations whose capitalization is only to a slight extent included directly or indirectly in the New Haven Railroad balance sheet. The New Haven, like most large corporations, is a holding company also; and a holding company may control subsidiaries while owning but a small part of the latters' outstanding securities. Only the small part so held will be represented in the holding company's balance sheet. Thus, while the New Haven Railroad's capitalization is only $385,000,000—and that sum only appears in the Pujo schedule—the capitalization of the New Haven System, as shown by a chart submitted to the Committee, is over twice as great; namely, $849,000,000.
   </p>
   <p>
   It is clear, therefore, that the $22,000,000,000, referred to by the Pujo Committee, understates the extent of concentration effected by the inner group of the Money Trust.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Cementing the Triple Alliance
   </h2>
   <p>
   Care was taken by these builders of imperial power that their structure should be enduring. It has been buttressed on every side by joint ownerships and mutual stockholdings, as well as by close personal re­lationships; for directorships are ephemeral and may end with a new election. Mr. Morgan and his partners acquired one-sixth of the stock of the First National Bank, and made a $6,000,000 investment in the stock of the National City Bank. Then J. P. Morgan & Co., the National City, and the First National (or their dominant officers—Mr. Stillman and Mr. Baker) acquired together, by stock purchases and voting trusts, control of the National Bank of Commerce, with its $190,000,000 of resources; of the Chase National, with $125,000,000; of the Guaranty Trust Company, with $232,000,000; of the Bankers' Trust Company, with $205,000,000; and of a number of smaller, but important, financial institutions. They became joint voting trustees in great railroad systems; and finally (as if the allies were united into a single concern) loyal and efficient service in the banks—like that rendered by Mr. Davison and Mr. Lamont in the First National—was rewarded by promotion to membership in the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Provincial Allies
   </h2>
   <p>
   Thus equipped and bound together, J. P. Morgan & Co., the National City and the First National easily dominated America's financial center, New York; for certain other important bankers, to be hereafter men­tioned, were held in restraint by "gentlemen's" agreements. The three allies dominated Philadelphia too; for the firm of Drexel & Co. is J. P. Morgan & Co. under another name. But there are two other important money centers in America, Boston and Chicago.
   </p>
   <p>
   In Boston there are two large international banking houses—Lee, Higginson & Co., and Kidder, Peabody & Co.—both long established and rich; and each possessing an extensive, wealthy clientele of eager investors in bonds and stocks. Since 1907 each of these firms has purchased or underwritten (principally in conjunction with other bankers) about 100 different security issues of the greater interstate corporations, the issues of each banker amounting in the aggregate to over $1,000,000,000. Concentration of banking capital has proceeded even further in Boston than in New York. By successive consolidations the number of national banks has been reduced from 58 in 1898 to 19 in 1913. There are in Boston now also 23 trust companies.
   </p>
   <p>
   The National Shawmut Bank, the First National Bank of Boston and the Old Colony Trust Co., which these two Boston banking houses and their associates control, alone have aggregate resources of $288,386,294, constituting about one-half of the banking resources of the city. These great banking institutions, which are themselves the result of many consolidations, and the 21 other banks and trust companies, in which their directors are also directors, hold together 90 per cent. of the total banking resources of Boston. And linked to them by interlocking directorates are 9 other banks and trust companies whose aggregate resources are about 2 1/2 per cent. of Boston's total, Thus of 42 banking institutions, 33, with aggregate resources of $560,516,239, holding about 92 1/2 per cent. of the aggregate banking resources of Boston, are interlocked. But even the remaining 9 banks and trust companies, which together hold but 7 1/2 per cent. of Boston banking resources, are not all independent of one another. Three are linked together; so that there appear to be only six banks in all Boston that are free from interlocking directorate relations. They together represent but 5 per cent. of Boston’s banking resources. And it may well be doubted whether all of even those 6 are entirely free from affiliation with the other groups.
   </p>
   <p>
   Boston's banking concentration is not limited to the legal confines of the city. Around Boston proper are over thirty suburbs, which with it form what is popularly known as "Greater Boston." These suburban municipalities, and also other important cities like Worcester and Springfield, are, in many respects, within Boston's "sphere of influence." Boston's inner banking group has interlocked, not only 33 of the 42 banks of Boston proper, as above shown, but has linked with them, by interlocking directorships, at least 42 other banks and trust companies in 35 other municipalities.
   </p>
   <p>
   Once Lee, Higginson & Co. and Kidder, Peabody & Co. were active competitors. They are so still in some small, or purely local matters; but both are devoted co­operators with the Morgan associates in larger and interstate transactions; and the alliance with these great Boston banking houses has been cemented by mutual stockholdings and co-directorships. Financial concentration seems to have found its highest expression in Boston.
   </p>
   <p>
   Somewhat similar relations exist between the triple alliance and Chicago’s great financial institutions—its First National Bank, the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank, and the Continental & Commercial National Bank—which together control resources of $561,000,000. And similar relations would doubtless be found to exist with the leading bankers of the other important financial centers of America, as to which the Pujo Committee was prevented by lack of time from making investigation.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Auxiliaries
   </h2>
   <p>
   Such are the primary, such the secondary powers which comprise the Money Trust; but these are supplemented by forces of magnitude.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Radiating from these principal groups," says the Pujo Committee, "and closely affiliated with them are smaller but important banking houses, such as Kissel, Kinnicut & Co., White, Weld & Co., and Harvey Fisk & Sons, who receive large and lucrative patronage from the dominating groups, and are used by the latter as jobbers or distributors of securities, the issuing of which they control, but which for reasons of their own they prefer not to have issued or distributed under their own names. Lee, Higginson & Co., besides being partners with the inner group, are also frequently utilized in this service because of their facilities as distributors of securities.”
   </p>
   <p>
   For instance, J. P. Morgan & Co. as fiscal agents of the New Haven Railroad had the right to market its securities and that of its subsidiaries. Among the numerous New Haven subsidiaries, is the New York, Westchester and Boston—the road which cost $1,500,000 a mile to build, and which earned adeficitlast year of nearly $1,500,000, besides failing to earn any return upon the New Haven's own stock and bond investment of $8,241,951. When the New Haven concluded to market $17,200,000 of these bonds, J. P. Morgan & Co., "for reasons of their own," "preferred not to have these bonds issued or distributed under their own name." The Morgan firm took the bonds at 92 1/2 net; and the bonds were marketed by Kissel, Kinnicut & Co. and others at 96 1/4.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Satellites
   </h2>
   <p>
   The alliance is still further supplemented as the Pujo Committee shows:
   </p>
   <p>
   "Beyond these inner groups and sub-groups are banks and bankers throughout the country who co­operate with them in underwriting or guaranteeing the sale of securities offered to the public, and who also act as distributors of such securities. It was impossible to learn the identity of these corporations, owing to the unwillingness of the members of the inner group to disclose the names of their underwriters, but sufficient appears to justify the statement that there are at least hundreds of them and that they extend into many of the cities throughout this and foreign countries.
   </p>
   <p>
   "The patronage thus proceeding from the inner group and its sub-groups is of great value to these banks and bankers, who are thus tied by self-interest to the great issuing houses and may be regarded as a part of this vast financial organization. Such patronage yields no inconsiderable part of the income of these banks and bankers and without much risk on account of the facilities of the principal groups for placing issues of securities through their domination of great banks and trust companies and their other domestic affiliations and their foreign connections. The under­writing commissions on issues made by this inner group are usually easily earned and do not ordinarily involve the underwriters in the purchase of the underwritten securities. Their interest in the transaction is generally adjusted unless they choose to purchase part of the securities, by the payment to them of a commission. There are, however, occasions on which this is not the case. The underwriters are then required to take the securities. Bankers and brokers are so anxious to be permitted to participate in these transactions under the lead of the inner group that as a rule they join when invited to do so, regardless of their approval of the particular business, lest by refusing they should thereafter cease to be invited."
   </p>
   <p>
   In other words, an invitation from these royal bankers is interpreted as a command. As a result, these great bankers frequently get huge commissions without themselves distributing any of the bonds, or ever having taken any actual risk.
   </p>
   <p>
   "In the case of the New York subway financing of $170,000,000 of bonds by Messrs. Morgan & Co. and their associates, Mr. Davison [as the Pujo Committee reports] estimated that there were from 100 to 125 such underwriters who were apparently glad to agree that Messrs. Morgan & Co., the First National Bank, and the National City Bank should receive 3 per cent.,—equal to $5,100,000—for forming this syndicate, thus relieving themselves from all liability, whilst the under­writers assumed the risk of what the bonds would realize and of being required to take their share of the unsold portion.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Protection of Pseudo-Ethics
   </h2>
   <p>
   The organization of the Money Trust is intensive, the combination comprehensive; but one other element was recognized as necessary to render it stable, and to make its dynamic force irresistible. Despotism, be it financial or political, is vulnerable, unless it is believed to rest upon a moral sanction. The longing for freedom is ineradicable. It will express itself in protest against servitude and inaction unless the striving for freedom be made to seem immoral. Long ago monarchs invented, as a preservative of absolutism, the fiction of "The divine right of kings." Bankers, imitating royalty, invented recently that precious rule of so-called "Ethics," by which it is declared unprofessional to come to the financial relief of any corporation which is already the prey of another "reputable" banker.

   <p>
   "The possibility of competition between these banking houses in the purchase of securities," says the Pujo Committee, "is further removed by the understanding between them and others, that one will not seek, by offering better terms, to take away from another, a customer which it has theretofore served, and by corollary of this, namely, that where given bankers have once satisfactorily united in bringing out an issue of a corporation, they shall also join in bringing out any subsequent issue of the same corporations. This is described as a principle of banking ethics.”
   </p>
   <p>
   The "Ethical" basis of the rule must be that the interests of the combined bankers are superior to the interests of the rest of the community. Their attitude reminds one of the "spheres of influence" with ample "hinterlands" by which rapacious nations are adjusting differences. Important banking concerns, too ambitious to be willing to take a subordinate position in the alliance, and too powerful to be suppressed, are accorded a financial "sphere of influence" upon the understanding that the rule of banking ethics will be faithfully observed. Most prominent among such lesser potentates are Kuhn, Loeb & Co., of New York, an international banking house of great wealth, with large clientele and connections. They are accorded an important "sphere of influence" in American railroading, including among other systems the Baltimore & Ohio, the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific. They and the Morgan group have with few exceptions preempted the banking business of the important railroads of the country. But even Kuhn, Loeb & Co. are not wholly independent. The Pujo Committee reports that they are "qualified allies of the inner group"; and through their "close relations with the National City Bank and the National Bank of Commerce and other financial institutions" have "many interests in common with the Morgan associates, conducting large joint-account operations with them.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Evils Resultant
   </h2>
   <p>
   First: These banker-barons levy, through their excessive exactions, a heavy toll upon the whole community; upon owners of money for leave to invest it; upon railroads, public service and industrial companies, for leave to use this money of other people; and, through these corporations, upon consumers.
   </p>
   <p>
   "The charge of capital," says the Pujo Committee, "which of course enters universally into the price of commodities and of service, is thus in effect determined by agreement amongst those supplying it and not under the check of competition. If there be any virtue in the principle of competition, certainly any plan or arrangement which prevents its operation in the performance of so fundamental a commercial function as the supplying of capital is peculiarly injurious.”
   </p>
   <p>
   Second:More serious, however, is the effect of the Money Trust in directly suppressing competition. That suppression enables the monopolist to extort excessive profits; but monopoly increases the burden of the consumer even more in other ways. Monopoly arrests development; and through arresting development, prevents that lessening of the cost of production and of distribution which would otherwise take place.
   </p>
   <p>
   Can full competition exist among the anthracite coal railroads when the Morgan associates are potent in all of them? And with like conditions prevailing, what competition is to be expected between the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern, the Southern, the Louisville and Nashville, and the Atlantic Coast Line; or between the Westinghouse Manufacturing Company and the General Electric Company? As the Pujo Committee finds:
   </p>
   <p>
   "Such affiliations tend as a cover and conduit for secret arrangements and understandings in restriction of competition through the agency of the banking house thus situated.”
   </p>
   <p>
   And under existing conditions of combination, relief through other banking houses is precluded.
   </p>
   <p>
   "It can hardly be expected that the banks, trust companies, and other institutions that are thus seeking participation from this inner group would be likely to engage in business of a character that would be dis­pleasing to the latter or would interfere with their plans or prestige. And so the protection that can be afforded by the members of the inner group constitutes the safest refuge of our great industrial combinations against future competition. The powerful grip of these gentlemen is upon the throttle that controls the wheels of credit, and upon their signal those wheels will turn or stop.”
   </p>
   <p>
   Third:But far more serious even than the suppression of competition is the suppression of industrial liberty, indeed of manhood itself, which this overweening financial power entails. The intimidation which it effects extends far beyond "the banks, trust companies, and other institutions seeking participation from this inner group in their lucrative underwritings"; and far beyond those interested in the great corporations directly dependent upon the inner group. Its blighting and benumbing effect extends as well to the small and seemingly independent business man, to the vast army of professional men and others directly dependent upon "Big Business," and to many another; for
   </p>
   <p>
   1. Nearly every enterprising business man needs bank credit. The granting of credit involves the exercise of judgment of the bank officials; and however honestly the bank officials may wish to exercise their discretion, experience shows that their judgment is warped by the existence of the all-pervading power of the Money Trust. He who openly opposes the great interests will often be found to lack that quality of "safe and sane"-ness which is the basis of financial credit.
   </p>
   <p>
   2. Nearly every enterprising business man and a large part of our professional men have something to sell to, or must buy something from, the great cor­porations to which the control or influence of the money lords extends directly, or from or to affiliated interests. Sometimes it is merchandise; sometimes it is service; sometimes they have nothing either to buy or to sell, but desire political or social advancement. Sometimes they want merely peace. Experience shows that "it is not healthy to buck against a locomotive," and "Business is business.”
   </p>
   <p>
   Here and there you will find a hero,—red-blooded, and courageous,—loving manhood more than wealth, place or security,—who dared to fight for independence and won. Here and there you may find the martyr, who resisted in silence and suffered with resignation. But America, which seeks "the greatest good of the greatest number," cannot be content with conditions that fit only the hero, the martyr or the slave.

   Chapter III: Interlocking Directorates
   </h1>
   <p>
   The practice of interlocking directorates is the root of many evils. It offends laws human and divine. Applied to rival corporations, it tends to the suppression of competition and to violation of the Sherman law. Applied to corporations which deal with each other, it tends to disloyalty and to violation of the fundamental law that no man can serve two masters. In either event it tends to inefficiency; for it removes incentive and destroys soundness of judgment. It is undemocratic, for it rejects the platform: "A fair field and no favors,"—substituting the pull of privilege for the push of manhood. It is the most potent instrument of the Money Trust. Break the control so exercised by the investment bankers over railroads, public-service and industrial corporations, over banks, life insurance and trust companies, and a long step will have been taken toward attainment of the New Freedom.
   </p>
   <p>
   The term "Interlocking directorates" is here used in a broad sense as including all intertwined conflicting interests, whatever the form, and by whatever device effected. The objection extends alike to contracts of a corporation whether with one of its directors individually, or with a firm of which he is a member, or with another corporation in which he is interested as an officer or director or stockholder. The objection extends likewise to men holding the inconsistent position of director in two potentially competing corporations, even if those corporations do not actually deal with each other.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Endless Chain
   </h2>
   <p>
   A single example will illustrate the vicious circle of control—the endless chain—through which our financial oligarchy now operates:
   </p>
   <p>
   J. P. Morgan (or a partner), a director of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad, causes that company to sell to J. P. Morgan & Co. an issue of bonds. J. P. Morgan & Co. borrow the money with which to pay for the bonds from the Guaranty Trust Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. J. P. Morgan & Co. sell the bonds to the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The New Haven spends the proceeds of the bonds in purchasing steel rails from the United States Steel Corporation, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The United States Steel Corporation spends the proceeds of the rails in purchasing electrical supplies from the General Electric Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The General Electric sells supplies to the Western Union Telegraph Company, a subsidiary of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company; and in both Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The Telegraph Company has an exclusive wire contract with the Reading, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The Reading buys its passenger cars from the Pullman Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The Pullman Company buys (for local use) locomotives from the Baldwin Locomotive Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The Reading, the General Electric, the Steel Corporation and the New Haven, like the Pullman, buy locomotives from the Baldwin Company. The Steel Corporation, the Telephone Company, the New Haven, the Reading, the Pullman and the Baldwin Companies, like the Western Union, buy electrical supplies from the General Electric. The Baldwin, the Pullman, the Reading, the Telephone, the Telegraph and the General Electric companies, like the New Haven, buy steel products from the Steel Corporation. Each and every one of the companies last named markets its securities through J. P. Morgan & Co.; each deposits its funds with J. P. Morgan & Co.; and with these funds of each, the firm enters upon further operations.
   </p>
   <p>
   This specific illustration is in part supposititious; but it represents truthfully the operation of interlocking directorates. Only it must be multiplied many times and with many permutations to represent fully the extent to which the interests of a few men are intertwined. Instead of taking the New Haven as the railroad starting point in our example, the New York Central, the Santa Fe, the Southern, the Lehigh Valley, the Chicago and Great Western, the Erie or the Père Marquette might have been selected; instead of the Guaranty Trust Company as the banking reservoir, any one of a dozen other important banks or trust companies; instead of the Penn Mutual as purchaser of the bonds, other insurance companies; instead of the General Electric, its qualified competitor, the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. The chain is indeed endless; for each controlled corporation is entwined with many others.
   </p>
   <p>
   As thenexusof "Big Business" the Steel Corporation stands, of course, preeminent: The Stanley Committee showed that the few men who control the Steel Corporation, itself an owner of important railroads, are directors also in twenty-nine other railroad systems, with 126,000 miles of line (more than half the railroad mileage of the United States), and in important steamship companies. Through all these alliances and the huge traffic it controls, the Steel Corporation's influence pervades railroad and steamship companies—not as carriers only—but as the largest customers for steel. And its influence with users of steel extends much further. These same few men are also directors in twelve steel-using street railway systems, including some of the largest in the world. They are directors in forty machinery and similar steel-using manufacturing companies; in many gas, oil and water companies, extensive users of iron products; and in the great wire-using telephone and telegraph companies. The aggregate assets of these different corporations—through which these few men exert their influence over the business of the United States—exceeds sixteen billion dollars.
   </p>
   <p>
   Obviously, interlocking directorates, and all that term implies, must be effectually prohibited before the freedom of American business can be regained. The prohibition will not be an innovation. It will merely give full legal sanction to the fundamental law of morals and of human nature: that "No man can serve two masters." The surprising fact is that a principle of equity so firmly rooted should have been departed from at all in dealing with corporations. For no rule of law has, in other connections, been more rigorously applied, than that which prohibits a trustee from occupying inconsistent positions, from dealing with himself, or from using his fiduciary position for personal profit. And a director of a corporation is as obviously a trustee as persons holding similar positions in an unincorporated association, or in a private trust estate, who are called specifically by that name. The Courts have recognized this fully.
   </p>
   <p>
   Thus, the Court of Appeals of New York declared in an important case:
   </p>
   <p>
   "While not technically trustees, for the title of the corporate property was in the corporation itself, they were charged with the duties and subject to the liabilities of trustees. Clothed with the power of controlling the property and managing the affairs of the corporation without let or hindrance, as to third persons, they were its agents; but as to the corporation itself equity holds them liable as trustees. While courts of law generally treat the directors as agents, courts of equity treat them as trustees, and hold them to a strict account for any breach of the trust relation. For all practical purposes they are trustees, when called upon in equity to account for their official conduct."
   </p>
   <h2>
   Nullifying the Law
   </h2>
   <p>
   But this wholesome rule of business, so clearly laid down, was practically nullified by courts in creating two unfortunate limitations, as concessions doubtless to the supposed needs of commerce.
   </p>
   <p>
   First: Courts held valid contracts between a corporation and a director, or between two corporations with a common director, where it was shown that in making the contract, the corporation was represented by independent directors and that the vote of the interested director was unnecessary to carry the motion and his presence was not needed to constitute a quorum.
   </p>
   <p>
   Second: Courts held that even where a common director participated actively in the making of a contract between two corporations, the contract was not absolutely void, but voidable only at the election of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
   The first limitation ignored the rule of law that a beneficiary is entitled to disinterested advice fromallhis trustees, and not merely from some; and that a trustee may violate his trust by inaction as well as by action. It ignored, also, the laws of human nature, in assuming that the influence of a director is confined to the act of voting. Every one knows that the most effective work is done before any vote is taken, subtly, and without provable participation. Every one should know that the denial of minority representation on boards of directors has resulted in the domination of most corporations by one or two men; and in practically banishing all criticism of the dominant power. And even where the board is not so dominated, there is too often that "harmonious cooperation" among directors which secures for each, in his own line, a due share of the corporation's favors.
   </p>
   <p>
   The second limitation—by which contracts, in the making of which the interested director participates actively, are heldmerely voidableinstead of absolutely void—ignores the teachings of experience. To hold such contracts merely voidable has resulted practically in declaring them valid. It is the directors who control corporate action; and there is little reason to expect that any contract, entered into by a board with a fellow director, however unfair, would be subsequently avoided. Appeals from Philip drunk to Philip sober are not of frequent occurrence, nor very fruitful. But here we lack even an appealing party. Directors and the dominant stockholders would, of course, not appeal; and the minority stockholders have rarely the knowledge of facts which is essential to an effective appeal, whether it be made to the directors, to the whole body of stockholders, or to the courts. Besides, the financial burden and the risks incident to any attempt of individual stockholders to interfere with an existing management is ordinarily prohibitive. Proceedings to avoid contracts with directors are, therefore, seldom brought, except after a radical change in the membership of the board. And radical changes in a board's membership are rare. Indeed the Pujo Committee reports:
   </p>
   <p>
   "None of the witnesses, (the leading American bankers testified) was able to name an instance in the history of the country in which the stockholders had succeeded in overthrowing an existing management in any large corporation. Nor does it appear that stockholders have ever even succeeded in so far as to secure the investigation of an existing management of a corporation to ascertain whether it has been well or honestly managed."
   </p>
   <p>
   Mr. Max Pam proposed in the April, 1913,Harvard Law Review, that the government come to the aid of minority stockholders. He urged that the president of every corporation be required to report annually to the stockholders, and to state and federal officials every contract made by the company in which any director is interested; that the Attorney-General of the United States or the State investigate the same and take proper proceedings to set all such contracts aside and recover any damages suffered; or without disaffirming the contracts to recover from the interested directors the profits derived therefrom. And to this end also, that State and National Bank Examiners, State Superintendents of Insurance, and the Interstate Commerce Commission be directed to examine the records of every bank, trust company, insurance company, railroad company and every other corporation engaged in interstate commerce. Mr. Pam's views concerning interlocking directorates are entitled to careful study. As counsel prominently identified with the organization of trusts, he had for years full opportunity of weighing the advantages and disadvantages of "Big Business." His conviction that the practice of interlocking directorates is a menace to the public and demands drastic legislation, is significant. And much can be said in support of the specific measure which he proposes. But to be effective, the remedy must be fundamental and comprehensive.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Essentials of Protection
   </h2>
   <p>
   Protection to minority stockholders demands that corporations be prohibited absolutely from making contracts in which a director has a private interest, and that all such contracts be declared not voidable merely, but absolutely void.
   </p>
   <p>
   In the case of railroads and public-service corporations (in contradistinction to private industrial companies), such prohibition is demanded, also, in the interests of the general public. For interlocking interests breed inefficiency and disloyalty; and the public pays, in higher rates or in poor service, a large part of the penalty for graft and inefficiency. Indeed, whether rates are adequate or excessive cannot be determined until it is known whether the gross earnings of the corporation are properly expended. For when a company's important contracts are made through directors who are interested on both sides, the common presumption that money spent has been properly spent does not prevail. And this is particularly true in railroading, where the company so often lacks effective competition in its own field.
   </p>
   <p>
   But the compelling reason for prohibiting interlocking directorates is neither the protection of stockholders, nor the protection of the public from the incidents of inefficiency and graft. Conclusive evidence (if obtainable) that the practice of interlocking directorates benefited all stockholders and was the most efficient form of organization, would not remove the objections. For even more important than efficiency are industrial and political liberty; and these are imperiled by the Money Trust.Interlocking directorates must be prohibited, because it is impossible to break the Money Trust without putting an end to the practice in the larger corporations.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Banks as Public-Service Corporations
   </h2>
   <p>
   The practice of interlocking directorates is peculiarly objectionable when applied to banks, because of the nature and functions of those institutions. Bank deposits are an important part of our currency system. They are almost as essential a factor in commerce as our railways. Receiving deposits and making loans therefrom should be treated by the law not as a private business, but as one of the public services. And recognizing it to be such, the law already regulates it in many ways. The function of a bank is to receive and to loan money. It has no more right than a common carrier to use its powers specifically to build up or to destroy other businesses. The granting or withholding of a loan should be determined, so far as concerns the borrower, solely by the interest rate and the risk involved; and not by favoritism or other considerations foreign to the banking function. Men may safely be allowed to grant or to deny loans of theirownmoney to whomsoever they see fit, whatsoever their motive may be. But bank resources are, in the main, not owned by the stockholders nor by the directors. Nearly three-fourths of the aggregate resources of the thirty-four banking institutions in which the Morgan associates hold a predominant influence are represented by deposits. The dependence of commerce and industry upon bank deposits, as the common reservoir of quick capital is so complete, that deposit banking should be recognized as one of the businesses "affected with a public interest." And the general rule which forbids public-service corporations from making unjust discriminations or giving undue preference should be applied to the operations of such banks.
   </p>
   <p>
   Senator Owen, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency, said recently:
   </p>
   <p>
   "My own judgment is that a bank is a public-utility institution and cannot be treated as a private affair, for the simple reason that the public is invited, under the safeguards of the government, to deposit its money with the bank, and the public has a right to have its interests safeguarded through organized authorities. The logic of this is beyond escape. All banks in the United States, public and private, should be treated as public-utility institutions, where they receive public deposits.”
   </p>
   <p>
   The directors and officers of banking institutions must, of course, be entrusted with wide discretion in the granting or denying of loans. But that discretion should be exercised, not only honestly as it affects stockholders, but also impartially as it affects the public. Mere honesty to the stockholders demands that the interests to be considered by the directors be the interests of all the stockholders; not the profit of the part of them who happen to be its directors. But the general welfare demands of the director, as trustee for the public, performance of a stricter duty. The fact that the granting of loans involves a delicate exercise of discretion makes it difficult to determine whether the rule of equality of treatment, which every public-service corporation owes, has been performed. But that difficulty merely emphasizes the importance of making absolute the rule that banks of deposit shall not make any loan nor engage in any transaction in which a director has a private interest. And we should bear this in mind: If privately-owned banks fail in the public duty to afford borrowers equality of opportunity, there will arise a demand for government-owned banks, which will become irresistible.
   </p>
   <p>
   The statement of Mr. Justice Holmes of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Oklahoma Bank case, is significant:
   </p>
   <p>
   "We cannot say that the public interests to which we have adverted, and others, are not sufficient to warrant the State in taking the whole business of banking under its control. On the contrary we are of opinion that it may go on from regulation to prohibition except upon such conditions as it may prescribe.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   Official Precedents
   </h2>
   <p>
   Nor would the requirement that banks shall make no loan in which a director has a private interest impose undue hardships or restrictions upon bank directors. It might make a bank director dispose of some of his investments and refrain from making others; but it often happens that the holding of one office precludes a man from holding another, or compels him to dispose of certain financial interests.
   </p>
   <p>
   A judge is disqualified from sitting in any case in which he has even the smallest financial interest; and most judges, in order to be free to act in any matters arising in their court, proceed, upon taking office, to dispose of all investments which could conceivably bias their judgment in any matter that might come before them. An Interstate Commerce Commissioner is prohibited from owning any bonds or stocks in any corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. It is a serious criminal offence for any executive officer of the federal government to transact government business with any corporation in the pecuniary profits of which he is directly or indirectly interested.
   </p>
   <p>
   And the directors of our great banking institutions, as the ultimate judges of bank credit, exercise today a function no less important to the country's welfare than that of the judges of our courts, the interstate commerce commissioners, and departmental heads.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Scope of the Prohibition
   </h2>
   <p>
   In the proposals for legislation on this subject, four important questions are presented:
   </p>
   <p>
   1. Shall the principle of prohibiting interlocking directorates in potentially competing corporations be applied to state banking institutions, as well as the national banks?
   </p>
   <p>
   2. Shall it be applied to all kinds of corporations or only to banking institutions?
   </p>
   <p>
   3. Shall the principle of prohibiting corporations from entering into transactions in which the management has a private interest be applied to both directors and officers or be confined in its application to officers only?
   </p>
   <p>
   4. Shall the principle be applied so as to prohibit transactions with another corporation in which one of its directors is interested merely as a stockholder?

   <h1>
   Chapter IV: Serve One Master Only
   </h1>
   <p>
   The Pujo Committee has presented the facts concerning the Money Trust so clearly that the conclusions appear inevitable. Their diagnosis discloses intense financial concentration and the means by which it is effected. Combination,—the intertwining of interests,—is shown to be the all-pervading vice of the present system. With a view to freeing industry, the Committee recommends the enactment of twenty-one specific remedial provisions. Most of these measures are wisely framed to meet some abuse disclosed by the evidence; and if all of these were adopted the Pujo legislation would undoubtedly alleviate present suffering and aid in arresting the disease. But many of the remedies proposed are "local" ones; and a cure is not possible, without treatment which is fundamental. Indeed, a major operation is necessary. This the Committee has hesitated to advise; although the fundamental treatment required is simple: "Serve one Master only.”
   </p>
   <p>
   The evils incident to interlocking directorates are, of course, fully recognized; but the prohibitions proposed in that respect are restricted to a very narrow sphere.
   </p>
   <p>
   First: The Committee recognizes that potentially competing corporations should not have a common director;—but it restricts this prohibition to directors of national banks, saying:
   </p>
   <p>
   "No officer or director of a national bank shall be an officer or director of any other bank or of any trust company or other financial or other corporation or institution, whether organized under state or federal law, that is authorized to receive money on deposit or that is engaged in the business of loaning money on collateral or in buying and selling securities except as in this section provided; and no person shall be an officer or director of any national bank who is a private banker or a member of a firm or partnership of bankers that is engaged in the business of receiving deposits: Provided, That such bank, trust company, financial institution, banker, or firm of bankers is located at or engaged in business at or in the same city, town, or village as that in which such national bank is located or engaged in business: Provided further, That a director of a national bank or a partner of such director may be an officer or director of not more than one trust company organized by the laws of the state in which such national bank is engaged in business and doing business at the same place.”
   </p>
   <p>
   Second: The Committee recognizes that a corporation should not make a contract in which one of the management has a private interest; but it restricts this prohibition (1) to national banks, and (2) to the officers, saying:
   </p>
   <p>
   "No national bank shall lend or advance money or credit or purchase or discount any promissory note, draft, bill of exchange or other evidence of debt bearing the signature or indorsement of any of its officers or of any partnership of which such officer is a member, directly or indirectly, or of any corporation in which such officer owns or has a beneficial interest of upward of ten per centum of the capital stock, or lend or advance money or credit to, for or on behalf of any such officer or of any such partnership or corporation, or purchase any security from any such officer or of or from any partnership or corporation of which such officer is a member or in which he is financially interested, as herein specified, or of any corporation of which any of its officers is an officer at the time of such transaction.”
   </p>
   <p>
   Prohibitions of intertwining relations so restricted, however supplemented by other provisions, will not end financial concentration. The Money Trust snake will, at most, be scotched, not killed. The prohibition of a common director in potentially competing corporations should apply to state banks and trust companies, as well as to national banks; and it should apply to railroad and industrial corporations as fully as to banking institutions. The prohibition of corporate contracts in which one of the management has a private interest should apply to directors, as well as to officers, and to state banks and trust companies and to other classes of corporations, as well as to national banks. And, as will be hereafter shown, such broad legislation is within the power of Congress.
   </p>
   <p>
   Let us examine this further:
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Prohibition of Common Directors in Potentially Competing Corporations
   </h2>
   <p>
   1.National Banks. The objection to common directors, as applied to banking institutions, is clearly shown by the Pujo Committee.
   </p>
   <p>
   "As the first and foremost step in applying a remedy, and also for reasons that seem to us conclusive, independently of that consideration, we recommend that interlocking directorates in potentially competing financial institutions be abolished and prohibited so far as lies in the power of Congress to bring about that result… When we find, as in a number of instances, the same man a director in half a dozen or more banks and trust companies all located in the same section of the same city, doing the same class of business and with a like set of associates similarly situated, all belonging to the same group and representing the same class of interests, all further pretense of competition is useless... If banks serving the same field are to be permitted to have common directors, genuine competition will be rendered impossible. Besides, this practice gives to such common directors the unfair advantage of knowing the affairs of borrowers in various banks, and thus affords endless opportunities for oppression.”
   </p>
   <p>
   This recommendation is in accordance with the legislation or practice of other countries. The Bank of England, the Bank of France, the National Bank of Belgium, and the leading banks of Scotland all exclude from their boards persons who are directors in other banks. By law, in Russia no person is allowed to be on the board of management of more than one bank.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Committee's recommendation is also in harmony with laws enacted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts more than a generation ago designed to curb financial concentration through the savings banks. Of the great wealth of Massachusetts a large part is represented by deposits in savings banks. These deposits are distributed among 194 different banks, located in 131 different cities and towns. These 194 banks are separate and distinct; not only in form, but in fact. In order that the banks may not be controlled by a few financiers, the Massachusetts law provides that no executive officer or trustee (director) of any savings bank can hold any office in any other savings bank. That statute was passed in 1876. A few years ago it was supplemented by providing that none of the executive officers of a savings bank could hold a similar office in any national bank. Massachusetts attempted thus to curb the power of the individual financier; and no disadvantages are discernible. When that Act was passed the aggregate deposits in its savings banks were $243,340,642; the number of deposit accounts 739,289; the average deposit to each person of the population $144. On November 1, 1912, the aggregate deposits were $838,635,097.85; the number of deposit accounts 2,200,917; the average deposit to each account $381.04. Massachusetts has shown that curbing the power of the few, at least in this respect, is entirely consistent with efficiency and with the prosperity of the whole people.
   </p>
   <p>
   2.State Banks and Trust Companies. The reason for prohibiting common directors in banking institutions applies equally to national banks and to state banks including those trust companies which are essentially banks. In New York City there are 37 trust companies of which only 15 are members of the clearing house; but those 15 had on November 2, 1912, aggregate resources of $827,875,653. Indeed the Bankers' Trust Company with resources of $205,000,000, and the Guaranty Trust Company, with resources of $232,000,000, are among the most useful tools of the Money Trust. No bank in the country has larger deposits than the latter; and only one bank larger deposits than the former. If common directorships were permitted in state banks or such trust companies, the charters of leading national banks would doubtless soon be surrendered; and the institutions would elude federal control by re-incorporating under state laws.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Pujo Committee has failed to apply the prohibition of common directorships in potentially competing banking institutions rigorously even to national banks. It permits the same man to be a director in one national bank and one trust company doing business in the same place. The proposed concession opens the door to grave dangers. In the first place the provision would permit the interlocking of any national bank not with one trust company only, but with as many trust companies as the bank has directors. For while under the Pujo bill no one can be a national bank director who is director in more than one such trust company, there is nothing to prevent each of the directors of a bank from becoming a director in a different trust company. The National Bank of Commerce of New York has a board of 38 directors. There are 37 trust companies in the City of New York. Thirty-seven of the 38 directors might each become a director of a different New York trust company: and thus 37 trust companies would be interlocked with the National Bank of Commerce, unless the other recommendation of the Pujo Committee limiting the number of directors to 13 were also adopted.
   </p>
   <p>
   But even if the bill were amended so as to limit the possible interlocking of a bank to a single trust company, the wisdom of the concession would still be doubtful. It is true, as the Pujo Committee states, that "the business that may be transacted by" a trust company is of "a different character" from that properly transacted by a national bank. But the business actually conducted by a trust company is, at least in the East, quite similar; and the two classes of banking institutions have these vital elements in common: each is a bank of deposit, and each makes loans from its deposits. A private banker may also transact some business of a character different from that properly conducted by a bank; but by the terms of the Committee's bill a private banker engaged in the business of receiving deposits would be prevented from being a director of a national bank; and the reasons underlying that prohibition apply equally to trust companies and to private bankers.
   </p>
   <p>
   3.Other Corporations. The interlocking of banking institutions is only one of the factors which have developed the Money Trust. The interlocking of other corporations has been an equally important element. And the prohibition of interlocking directorates should be extended to potentially competing corporations whatever the class; to life insurance companies, railroads and industrial companies, as well as banking institutions. The Pujo Committee has shown that Mr. George F. Baker is a common director in the six railroads which haul 80 per cent. of all anthracite marketed and own 88 per cent. of all anthracite deposits. The Morgan associates are thenexusbetween such supposedly competing railroads as the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern; the Southern, the Louisville & Nashville and the Atlantic Coast Line, and between partially competing industrials like the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company and the General Electric. Thenexus between all the large potentially competing corporations must be severed, if the Money Trust is to be broken.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Prohibiting Corporate Contracts in Which the Management has a Private Interest
   </h2>
   <p>
   The principle of prohibiting corporate contracts in which the management has a private interest is applied, in the Pujo Committee's recommendations, only to national banks, and in them only to officers. All other corporations are to be permitted to continue the practice; and even in national banks the directors are to be free to have a conflicting private interest, except that they must not accept compensation for promoting a loan of bank funds nor participate in syndicates, promotions or underwriting of securities in which their banks may be interested as underwriters or owners or lenders thereon: that all loans or other transactions in which a director is interested shall be made in his own name; and shall be authorized only after ample notice to co-directors; and that the facts shall be spread upon the records of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Money Trust would not be disturbed by a prohibition limited to officers. Under a law of that character, financial control would continue to be exercised by the few without substantial impairment; but the power would be exerted through a somewhat different channel. Bank officers are appointees of the directors; and ordinarily their obedient servants. Individuals who, as bank officers, are now important factors in the financial concentration, would doubtless resign as officers and become merely directors. The loss of official salaries involved could be easily compensated. No member of the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. is an officer in any one of the thirteen banking institutions with aggregate resources of $1,283,000,000, through which as directors they carry on their vast operations. A prohibition limited to officers would not affect the Morgan operations with these banking institutions. If there were minority representation on bank boards (which the Pujo Committee wisely advocates), such a provision might afford some protection to stockholders through the vigilance of the minority directors preventing the dominant directors using their power to the injury of the minority stockholders. But even then, the provision would not safeguard the public; and the primary purpose of Money Trust legislation is not to prevent directors from injuring stockholders; but to prevent their injuring the public through the intertwined control of the banks. No prohibition limited to officers will materially change this condition.
   </p>
   <p>
   The prohibition of interlocking directorates, even if applied only to all banks and trust companies, would practically compel the Morgan representatives to resign from the directorates of the thirteen banking institutions with which they are connected, or from the directorates of all the railroads, express, steamship, public utility, manufacturing, and other corporations which do business with those banks and trust companies. Whether they resigned from the one or the other class of corporations, the endless chain would be broken into many pieces. And whether they retired or not, the Morgan power would obviously be greatly lessened: for if they did not retire, their field of operations would be greatly narrowed.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Apply the Private Interest Prohibition to All Kinds of Corporations
   </h2>
   <p>
   The creation of the Money Trust is due quite as much to the encroachment of the investment banker upon railroads, public service, industrial, and life-insurance companies, as to his control of banks and trust companies. Before the Money Trust can be broken, all these relations must be severed. And they cannot be severed unless corporations of each of these several classes are prevented from dealing with their own directors and with corporations in which those directors are interested. For instance: The most potent single source of J. P. Morgan & Co.'s power is the $162,500,000 deposits, including those of 78 interstate railroad, public-service and industrial corporations, which the Morgan firm is free to use as it sees fit. The proposed prohibition, even if applied to all banking institutions, would not affect directly this great source of Morgan power. If, however, the prohibition is made to include railroad, public-service, and industrial corporations, as well as banking institutions, members of J. P. Morgan & Co. will quickly retire from substantially all boards of directors.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Apply the Private Interest Prohibition to Stockholding Interests
   </h2>
   <p>
   The prohibition against one corporation entering into transactions with another corporation in which one of its directors is also interested, should apply even if his interest in the second corporation is merely that of stockholder. A conflict of interests in a director may be just as serious where he is a stockholder only in the second corporation, as if he were also a director.
   </p>
   <p>
   One of the annoying petty monopolies, concerning which evidence was taken by the Pujo Committee, is the exclusive privilege granted to the American Bank Note Company by the New York Stock Exchange. A recent $60,000,000 issue of New York City bonds was denied listing on the Exchange, because the city refused to submit to an exaction of $55,800 by the American Company for engraving the bonds, when the New York Bank Note Company would do the work equally well for $44,500. As tending to explain this extraordinary monopoly, it was shown that men prominent in the financial world were stockholders in the American Company. Among the largest stockholders was Mr. Morgan, with 6,000 shares. No member of the Morgan firm was a director of the American Company; but there was sufficient influence exerted somehow to give the American Company the stock exchange monopoly.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Pujo Committee, while failing to recommend that transactions in which a director has a private interest be prohibited, recognizes that a stockholder's interest of more than a certain size may be as potent an instrument of influence as a direct personal interest; for it recommends that:
   </p>
   <p>
   "Borrowings, directly or indirectly by … any corporation of the stock of which he (a bank director) holds upwards of 10 per cent. from the bank of which he is such director, should only be permitted, on condition that notice shall have been given to his co-directors and that a full statement of the transaction shall be entered upon the minutes of the meeting at which such loan was authorized.”
   </p>
   <p>
   As shown above, the particular provision for notice affords no protection to the public; but if it did, its application ought to be extended to lesser stockholdings. Indeed it is difficult to fix a limit so low that financial interest will not influence action. Certainly a stockholding interest of a single director, much smaller than 10 per cent., might be most effective in inducing favors. Mr. Morgan’s stockholdings in the American Bank Note Company was only three per cent. The $6,000,000 investment of J. P. Morgan & Co. in the National City Bank represented only 6 per cent. of the bank's stock; and would undoubtedly have been effective, even if it had not been supplemented by the election of his son to the board of directors.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Special Disqualifications
   </h2>
   <p>
   The Stanley Committee, after investigation of the Steel Trust, concluded that the evils of interlocking directorates were so serious that representatives of certain industries which are largely dependent upon railroads should be absolutely prohibited from serving as railroad directors, officers or employees. It, therefore, proposed to disqualify as railroad director, officer or employee any person engaged in the business of manufacturing or selling railroad cars or locomotives, railroad rail or structural steel, or in mining and selling coal. The drastic Stanley bill, shows how great is the desire to do away with present abuses and to lessen the power of the Money Trust.
   </p>
   <p>
   Directors, officers, and employees of banking institutions should, by a similar provision, be disqualified from acting as directors, officers or employees of life-insurance companies. The Armstrong investigation showed that life-insurance companies were in 1905 the most potent factor in financial concentration. Their power was exercised largely through the banks and trust companies which they controlled by stock ownership and their huge deposits. The Armstrong legislation directed life-insurance companies to sell their stocks. The Mutual Life and the Equitable did so in part. But the Morgan associates bought the stocks. And now, instead of the life-insurance companies controlling the banks and trust companies, the latter and the bankers control the life-insurance companies.
   </p>
   <h2>
   How the Prohibition May Be Limited
   </h2>
   <p>
   The Money Trust cannot be destroyed unless allclassesof corporations are included in the prohibition of interlocking directors and of transactions by corporations in which the management has a private interest. But it does not follow that the prohibition must apply toevery corporation of each class. Certain exceptions are entirely consistent with merely protecting the public against the Money Trust; although protection of minority stockholders and business ethics demand that the rule prohibiting a corporation from making contracts in which a director has a private financial interest should be universal in its application. The number of corporations in the United States Dec. 31, 1912, was 305,336. Of these only 1610 have a capital of more than $5,000,000. Few corporations (other than banks) with a capital of less than $5,000,000 could appreciably affect general credit conditions either through their own operations or their affiliations. Corporations (other than banks) with capital resources of less than $5,000,000 might, therefore, be excluded from the scope of the statute for the present. The prohibition could also be limited so as not to apply to any industrial concern, regardless of the amount of capital and resources, doing only an intrastate business; as practically all large industrial corporations are engaged in interstate commerce. This would exclude some retail concerns and local jobbers and manufacturers not otherwise excluded from the operation of the act. Likewise banks and trust companies located in cities of less than 100,000 inhabitants might, if thought advisable, be excluded, for the present if their capital is less than $500,000, and their resources less than, say, $2,500,000. In larger cities even the smaller banking institutions should be subject to the law. Such exceptions should overcome any objection which might be raised that in some smaller cities, the prohibition of interlocking directorates would exclude from the bank directorates all the able business men of the community through fear of losing the opportunity of bank accommodations.
   </p>
   <p>
   An exception should also be made, so as to permit interlocking directorates between a corporation and its proper subsidiaries. And the prohibition of transactions in which the management has a private interest should, of course, not apply to contracts, express or implied, for such services as are performed indiscriminately for the whole community by railroads and public service corporations, or for services, common to all customers, like the ordinary service of a bank for its depositors.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Power of Congress
   </h2>
   <p>
   The question may be asked: Has Congress the power to impose these limitations upon the conduct of any business other than national banks? And if the power of Congress is so limited, will not the dominant financiers, upon the enactment of such a law, convert their national banks into state banks or trust companies, and thus escape from congressional control?
   </p>
   <p>
   The answer to both questions is clear. Congress has ample power to impose such prohibitions upon practically all corporations, including state banks, trust companies and life insurance companies; and evasion may be made impossible. While Congress has not been granted power to regulatedirectlystate banks, and trust or life insurance companies, or railroad, public-service and industrial corporations, except in respect to interstate commerce, it may do soindirectlyby virtue either of its control of the mail privilege or through the taxing power.
   </p>
   <p>
   Practically no business in the United States can be conducted without use of the mails; and Congress may in its reasonable discretion deny the use of the mail to any business which is conducted under conditions deemed by Congress to be injurious to the public welfare. Thus, Congress has no power directly to suppress lotteries; but it has indirectly suppressed them by denying, under heavy penalty, the use of the mail to lottery enterprises. Congress has no power to suppress directly business frauds; but it is constantly doing so indirectly by issuing fraud-orders denying the mail privilege. Congress has no direct power to require a newspaper to publish a list of its proprietors and the amount of its circulation, or to require it to mark paid-matter distinctly as advertising: But it has thus regulated the press, by denying the second-class mail privilege, to all publications which fail to comply with the requirements prescribed.
   </p>
   <p>
   The taxing power has been restored to by Congress for like purposes: Congress has no power to regulate the manufacture of matches, or the use of oleomargarine; but it has suppressed the manufacture of the "white phosphorous" match and has greatly lessened the use of oleomargarine by imposing heavy taxes upon them. Congress has no power to prohibit, or to regulate directly the issue of bank notes by state banks, but it indirectly prohibited their issue by imposing a tax of ten per cent. upon any bank note issued by a state bank.
   </p>
   <p>
   The power of Congress over interstate commerce has been similarly utilized. Congress cannot ordinarily provide compensation for accidents to employees or undertake directly to suppress prostitution; but it has, as an incident of regulating interstate commerce, enacted the Railroad Employers' Liability law and the White Slave Law; and it has full power over the instrumentalities of commerce, like the telegraph and the telephone.
   </p>
   <p>
   As such exercise of congressional power has been common for, at least, half a century, Congress should not hesitate now to employ it where its exercise is urgently needed. For a comprehensive prohibition of interlocking directorates is an essential condition of our attaining the New Freedom. Such a law would involve a great change in the relation of the leading banks and bankers to other businesses. But it is the very purpose of Money Trust legislation to effect a great change; and unless it does so, the power of our financial oligarchy cannot be broken.
   </p>
   <p>
   But though the enactment of such a law is essential to the emancipation of business, it will notalonerestore industrial liberty. It must be supplemented by other remedial measures.

   Chapter V: What Publicity Can Do
   </h1>
   <p>
   Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman. And publicity has already played an important part in the struggle against the Money Trust. The Pujo Committee has, in the disclosure of the facts concerning financial concentration, made a most important contribution toward attainment of the New Freedom. The battlefield has been surveyed and charted. The hostile forces have been located, counted and appraised. That was a necessary first step—and a long one—towards relief. The provisions in the Committee's bill concerning the incorporation of stock exchanges and the statement to be made in connection with the listing of securities would doubtless have a beneficent effect. But there should be a further call upon publicity for service. That potent force must, in the impending struggle, be utilized in many ways as a continuous remedial measure.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Wealth
   </h2>
   <p>
   Combination and control of other people's money and of other people's businesses. These are the main factors in the development of the Money Trust. But the wealth of the investment banker is also a factor. And with the extraordinary growth of his wealth in recent years, the relative importance of wealth as a factor in financial concentration has grown steadily. It was wealth which enabled Mr. Morgan, in 1910, to pay $3,000,000 for $51,000 par value of the stock of the Equitable Life Insurance Society. His direct income from this investment was limited by law to less than one-eighth of one per cent. a year; but it gave legal control of $504,000,000 of assets. It was wealth which enabled the Morgan associates to buy, from the Equitable and the Mutual Life Insurance Company the stocks in the several banking institutions, which, merged in the Bankers' Trust Company and the Guaranty Trust Company, gave them control of $357,000,000 deposits. It was wealth which enabled Mr. Morgan to acquire his shares in the First National and National City banks, worth $21,000,000, through which he cemented the triple alliance with those institutions.
   </p>
   <p>
   Now, how has this great wealth been accumulated? Some of it was natural accretion. Some of it is due to special opportunities for investment wisely availed of. Some of it is due to the vast extent of the bankers' operations. Then power breeds wealth as wealth breeds power. But a main cause of these large fortunes is the huge tolls taken by those who control the avenues to capital and to investors. There has been exacted as toll literally "all that the traffic will bear.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   Excessive Bankers’ Commissions
   </h2>
   <p>
   The Pujo Committee was unfortunately prevented by lack of time from presenting to the country the evidence covering the amounts taken by the investment bankers as promoters' fees, underwriting commissions and profits. Nothing could have demonstrated so clearly the power exercised by the bankers, as a schedule showing the aggregate of these taxes levied within recent years. It would be well worth while now to reopen the Money Trust investigation merely to collect these data. But earlier investigations have disclosed some illuminating, though sporadic facts.
   </p>
   <p>
   The syndicate which promoted the Steel Trust, took, as compensation for a few weeks' work, securities yielding $62,500,000 in cash; and of this, J. P. Morgan & Co. received for their services, as Syndicate Managers, $12,500,000, besides their share, as syndicate subscribers, in the remaining $50,000,000. The Morgan syndicate took for promoting the Tube Trust $20,000,000 common stock out of a total issue of $80,000,000 stock (preferred and common). Nor were monster commissions limited to trust promotions. More recently, bankers' syndicates have, in many instances, received for floating preferred stocks of recapitalized industrial concerns, one-third of all common stock issued, besides a considerable sum in cash. And for the sale of preferred stock of well established manufacturing concerns, cash commissions (or profits) of from 7 1/2 to 10 per cent. of the cash raised are often exacted. On bonds of high-class industrial concerns, bankers' commissions (or profits) of from 5 to 10 points have been common.
   </p>
   <p>
   Nor have these heavy charges been confined to industrial concerns. Even railroad securities, supposedly of high grade, have been subjected to like burdens. At a time when the New Haven's credit was still unimpaired, J. P. Morgan & Co. took the New York, Westchester & Boston Railway first mortgage bonds, guaranteed by the New Haven at 92 1/2; and they were marketed at 96 1/4. They took the Portland Terminal Company bonds, guaranteed by the Maine Central Railroad—a corporation of unquestionable credit—at about 88, and these were marketed at 92.
   </p>
   <p>
   A large part of these underwriting commissions is taken by the great banking houses, not for their services in selling the bonds, nor in assuming risks, but for securing others to sell the bonds and incur risks. Thus when the Interboro Railway—a most prosperous corporation—financed its recent $170,000,000 bond issue, J. P. Morgan & Co. received a 3 per cent. commission, that is, $5,100,000, practically for arranging that others should underwrite and sell the bonds.
   </p>
   <p>
   The aggregate commissions or profits so taken by leading banking houses can only be conjectured, as the full amount of their transactions has not been disclosed, and the rate of commission or profit varies very widely. But the Pujo Committee has supplied some interesting data bearing upon the subject: Counting the issues of securities of interstate corporations only, J. P. Morgan & Co. directly procured the public marketing alone or in conjunction with others during the years 1902-1912, of $1,950,000,000. What the average commission or profit taken by J. P. Morgan & Co. was we do not know; but we do know that every one per cent. on that sum yields $19,500,000. Yet even that huge aggregate of $1,950,000,000 includes only a part of the securities on which commissions or profits were paid. It does not include any issue of an intrastate corporation. It does not include any securities privately marketed. It does not include any government, state or municipal bonds.
   </p>
   <p>
   It is to exactions such as these that the wealth of the investment banker is in large part due. And since this wealth is an important factor in the creation of the power exercised by the Money Trust, we must endeavor to put an end to this improper wealth getting, as well as to improper combination. The Money Trust is so powerful and so firmly entrenched, that each of the sources of its undue power must be effectually stopped, if we would attain the New Freedom.
   </p>
   <h2>
   How Shall Excessive Charges Be Stopped?
   </h2>
   <p>
   The Pujo Committee recommends, as a remedy for such excessive charges, that interstate corporations be prohibited from entering into any agreements creating a sole fiscal agent to dispose of their security issues; that the issue of the securities of interstate railroads be placed under the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission; and that their securities should be disposed of only upon public or private competitive bids, or under regulations to be prescribed by the Commission with full powers of investigation that will discover and punish combinations which prevent competition in bidding. Some of the state public-service commissions now exercise such power; and it may possibly be wise to confer this power upon the interstate commission, although the recommendation of the Hadley Railroad Securities Commission are to the contrary. But the official regulation as proposed by the Pujo Committee would be confined to railroad corporations; and the new security issues of other corporations listed on the New York Stock Exchange have aggregated in the last five years $4,525,404,025, which is more than either the railroad or the municipal issues. Publicity offers, however, another and even more promising remedy: a method of regulating bankers' charges which would apply automatically to railroad, public-service and industrial corporations alike.
   </p>
   <p>
   The question may be asked: Why have these excessive charges been submitted to? Corporations, which in the first instance bear the charges for capital, have, doubtless, submitted because of banker-control; exercised directly through interlocking directorates, or kindred relations, and indirectly through combinations among bankers to suppress competition. But why have the investors submitted, since ultimately all these charges are borne by the investors, except so far as corporations succeed in shifting the burden upon the community? The large army of small investors, constituting a substantial majority of all security buyers, are entirely free from banker control. Their submission is undoubtedly due, in part, to the fact that the bankers control the avenues to recognizedly safe investments almost as fully as they do the avenues to capital. But the investor's servility is due partly, also, to his ignorance of the facts. Is it not probable that, if each investor knew the extent to which the security he buys from the banker is diluted by excessive underwritings, commissions and profits, there would be a strike of capital against these unjust exactions?
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Strike of Capital
   </h2>
   <p>
   A recent British experience supports this view. In a brief period last spring nine different issues, aggregating $135,840,000, were offered by syndicates on the London market, and on the average only about 10 per cent. of these loans was taken by the public. Money was "tight," but the rates of interest offered were very liberal, and no one doubted that the investors were well supplied with funds.The London Daily Mail presented an explanation:
   </p>
   <p>
   "The long series of rebuffs to new loans at the hands of investors reached a climax in the ill success of the great Rothschild issue. It will remain a topic of financial discussion for many days, and many in the city are expressing the opinion that it may have a revolutionary effect upon the present system of loan issuing and underwriting. The question being discussed is that the public have become loth to subscribe for stock which they believe the underwriters can afford, by reason of the commission they receive, to sell subsequently at a lower price than the issue price, and that the Stock Exchange has begun to realize the public's attitude. The public sees in the underwriter not so much one who insures that the loan shall be subscribed in return for its commission as a middleman, who, as it were, has an opportunity of obtaining stock at a lower price than the public in order that he may pass it off at a profit subsequently. They prefer not to subscribe, but to await an opportunity of dividing that profit. They feel that if, when these issues were made, the stock were offered them at a more attractive price, there would be less need to pay the underwriters so high commissions. It is another practical protest, if indirect, against the existence of the middleman, which protest is one of the features of present-day finance.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   Publicity as a Remedy
   </h2>
   <p>
   Compel bankers when issuing securities to make public the commissions or profits they are receiving. Let every circular letter, prospectus or advertisement of a bond or stock show clearly what the banker received for his middleman-services, and what the bonds and stocks net the issuing corporation. That is knowledge to which both the existing security holder and the prospective purchaser is fairly entitled. If the bankers' compensation is reasonable, considering the skill and risk involved, there can be no objection to making it known. If it is not reasonable, the investor will "strike," as investors seem to have done recently in England.
   </p>
   <p>
   Such disclosures of bankers' commissions or profits is demanded also for another reason: It will aid the investor in judging of the safety of the investment. In the marketing of securities there are two classes of risks: One is the risk whether the banker (or the corporation) will find ready purchasers for the bonds or stock at the issue price; the other whether the investor will get a good article. The maker of the security and the banker are interested chiefly in getting it sold at the issue price. The investor is interested chiefly in buying a good article. The small investor relies almost exclusively upon the banker for his knowledge and judgment as to the quality of the security; and it is this which makes his relation to the banker one of confidence. But at present, the investment banker occupies a position inconsistent with that relation. The bankers' compensation should, of course, vary according to the riskheassumes. Where there is a large risk that the bonds or stock will not be promptly sold at the issue price, the underwriting commission (that is the insurance premium) should be correspondingly large. But the banker ought not to be paid more for gettinginvestorsto assume a larger risk. In practice the banker gets the higher commission for underwriting the weaker security, on the ground that his own risk is greater. And the weaker the security, the greater is the banker's incentive to induce his customers to relieve him. Now the law should not undertake (except incidentally in connection with railroads and public-service corporations) to fix bankers' profits. And it should not seek to prevent investors from making bad bargains. But it is now recognized in the simplest merchandising, that there should be full disclosures. The archaic doctrine ofcaveat emptoris vanishing. The law has begun to require publicity in aid of fair dealing. The Federal Pure Food Law does not guarantee quality or prices; but it helps the buyer to judge of quality by requiring disclosure of ingredients. Among the most important facts to be learned for determining the real value of a security is the amount of water it contains. And any excessive amount paid to the banker for marketing a security is water. Require a full disclosure to the investor of the amount of commissions and profits paid; and not only will investors be put on their guard, but bankers' compensation will tend to adjust itself automatically to what is fair and reasonable. Excessive commissions—this form of unjustly acquired wealth—will in large part cease.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Real Disclosure
   </h2>
   <p>
   But the disclosure must be real. And it must be a disclosure to the investor. It will not suffice to require merely the filing of a statement of facts with the Commissioner of Corporations or with a score of other officials, federal and state. That would be almost as ineffective as if the Pure Food Law required a manufacturer merely to deposit with the Department a statement of ingredients, instead of requiring the label to tell the story. Nor would the filing of a full statement with the Stock Exchange, if incorporated, as provided by the Pujo Committee bill, be adequate.
   </p>
   <p>
   To be effective, knowledge of the facts must be actually brought home to the investor, and this can best be done by requiring the facts to be stated in good, large type in every notice, circular, letter and advertisement inviting the investor to purchase. Compliance with this requirement should also be obligatory, and not something which the investor could waive. For the whole public is interested in putting an end to the bankers' exactions. England undertook, years ago, to protect its investors against the wiles of promoters, by requiring a somewhat similar disclosure; but the British act failed, in large measure of its purpose, partly because under it the statement of facts was filed only with a public official, and partly because the investor could waive the provision. And the British statute has now been changed in the latter respect.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Disclose Syndicate Particulars
   </h2>
   <p>
   The required publicity should also include a disclosure of all participants in an underwriting. It is a common incident of underwriting that no member of the syndicate shall sell at less than the syndicate price for a definite period, unless the syndicate is sooner dissolved. In other words, the bankers make by agreement, an artificial price. Often the agreement is probably illegal under the Sherman Anti-Trust Law. This price maintenance is, however, not necessarily objectionable. It may be entirely consistent with the general welfare, if the facts are made known. But disclosure should include a list of those participating in the underwriting so that the public may not be misled. The investor should know whether his adviser is disinterested.
   </p>
   <p>
   Not long ago a member of a leading banking house was undertaking to justify a commission taken by his firm for floating a now favorite preferred stock of a manufacturing concern. The bankers took for their services $250,000 in cash, besides one-third of the common stock, amounting to about $2,000,000. "Of course," he said, "that would have been too much if we could have kept it all for ourselves; but we couldn’t. We had to divide up a large part. There were fifty-seven participants. Why, we had even to give $10,000 of stock to ———— (naming the president of a leading bank in the city where the business was located). He might some day have been asked what he thought of the stock. If he had shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't know, we might have lost many a customer for the stock. We had to give him $10,000 of the stock to teach him not to shrug his shoulders.”

   Think of the effectiveness with practical Americans of a statement like this:

   A. B. & CO.
   </p>
   <p>
   Investment Bankers
   </p>
   <p>
   We have today secured substantial control of the successful machinery business heretofore conducted by ——— at ———, Illinois, which has been incorporated under the name of the Excelsior Manufacturing Company with a capital of $10,000,000, of which $5,000,000 is Preferred and $5,000,000 Common.
   </p>
   <p>
   As we have a large clientele of confiding customers, we were able to secure from the owners an agreement for marketing the Preferred stock—we to fix a price which shall net the owners in cash $95 a share.
   </p>
   <p>
   We offer this excellent stock to you at $100.75 per share. Our own commission or profit will be only a little over $5.00 per share, or say, $250,000 cash, besides $1,500,000 of the Common stock, which we received as a bonus. This cash and stock commission we are to divide in various proportions with the following participants in the underwriting syndicate:
   </p>
   <p>
   C. D. & Co., New York
   </p>
   <p>
   E. F. & Co., Boston
   </p>
   <p>
   L. M. & Co., Philadelphia
   </p>
   <p>
   I. K. & Co., New York
   </p>
   <p>
   O. P. & Co., Chicago
   </p>
   <p>
   Were such notices common, the investment bankers would "be worthy of their hire," for only reasonable compensation would ordinarily be taken.
   </p>
   <p>
   For marketing the preferred stock, as in the case of Excelsior Manufacturing Co. referred to above, investment bankers were doubtless essential, and as middlemen they performed a useful service. But they used their strong position to make an excessive charge. There are, however, many cases where the banker's services can be altogether dispensed with; and where that is possible he should be eliminated, not only for economy's sake, but to break up financial concentration.

   Chapter VI: Where the Banker is Superfluous
   </h1>
   <p>
   The abolition of interlocking directorates will greatly curtail the bankers' power by putting an end to many improper combinations. Publicity concerning bankers' commissions, profits and associates, will lend effective aid, particularly by curbing undue exactions. Many of the specific measures recommended by the Pujo Committee (some of them dealing with technical details) will go far toward correcting corporate and banking abuses; and thus tend to arrest financial concentration. But the investment banker has, within his legitimate province, acquired control so extensive as to menace the public welfare even where his business is properly conducted. If the New Freedom is to be attained, every proper means of lessening that power must be availed of. A simple and effective remedy, which can be widely applied, even without new legislation, lies near at hand: Eliminate the banker-middleman where he is superfluous.
   </p>
   <p>
   Today practically all governments, states and municipalities pay toll to the banker on all bonds sold. Why should they? It is not because the banker is always needed. It is because the banker controls the only avenue through which the investor in bonds and stocks can ordinarily be reached. The banker has become the universal tax gatherer. True, thepro rataof taxes levied by him upon our state and city governments is less than that levied by him upon the corporations. But few states or cities escape payment of some such tax to the banker on every loan it makes. Even where the new issues of bonds are sold at public auction, or to the highest bidder on sealed proposals, the bankers' syndicates usually secure large blocks of the bonds which are sold to the people at a considerable profit. The middleman, even though unnecessary, collects his tribute.
   </p>
   <p>
   There is a legitimate field for dealers in state and municipal bonds, as for other merchants. Investors already owning such bonds must have a medium through which they can sell their holdings. And those states or municipalities which lack an established reputation among investors, or which must seek more distant markets, need the banker to distribute new issues. But there are many states and cities which have an established reputation and have a home market at hand. These should sell their bonds direct to investors without the intervention of a middleman. And as like conditions prevail with some corporations, their bonds and stocks should also be sold direct to the investor. Both financial efficiency and industrial liberty demand that the bankers' toll be abolished, where that is possible.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Banker and Broker
   </h2>
   <p>
   The business of the investment banker must not be confused with that of the bond and stock broker. The two are often combined; but the functions are essentially different. The broker performs a very limited service. He has properly nothing to do with the original issue of securities, nor with their introduction into the market. He merely negotiates a purchase or sale as agent for another under specific orders. He exercises no discretion, except in the method of bringing buyer and seller together, or of executing orders. For his humble service he receives a moderate compensation, a commission, usually one-eighth of one per cent. (12 ½ cents for each $100) on the par value of the security sold. The investment banker also is a mere middleman. But he is a principal, not an agent. He is also a merchant in bonds and stocks. The compensation received for his part in the transaction is in many cases more accurately described as profit than as commission. So far as concerns new issues of government, state and municipal bonds, especially, he acts as merchant, buying and selling securities on his own behalf; buying commonly at wholesale from the maker and selling at retail to the investors; taking the merchant's risk and the merchant’s profits. On purchases of corporate securities the profits are often very large; but even a large profit may be entirely proper; for when the banker's services are needed and are properly performed, they are of great value. On purchases of government, state and municipal securities the profit is usually smaller; but even a very small profit cannot be justified, if unnecessary.
   </p>
   <h2>
   How the Banker Can Serve
   </h2>
   <p>
   The banker's services include three distinct functions, and only three:
   </p>
   <p>
   First: Specifically as expert. The investment banker has the responsibility of the ordinary retailer to sell only that merchandise which is good of its kind. But his responsibility in this respect is unusually heavy, because he deals in an article on which a great majority of his customers are unable, themselves, to pass intelligent judgment without aid. The purchase by the investor of most corporate securities is little better than a gamble, where he fails to get the advice of some one who has investigated the security thoroughly as the banker should. For few investors have the time, the facilities, or the ability to investigate properly the value of corporate securities.
   </p>
   <p>
   Second: Specifically as distributor. The banker performs an all-important service in providing an outlet for securities. His connections enable him to reach possible buyers quickly. And good-will—that is, possession of the confidence of regular customers—enables him to effect sales where the maker of the security might utterly fail to find a market.
   </p>
   <p>
   Third: Specifically as jobber or retailer. The investment banker, like other merchants, carries his stock in trade until it can be marketed. In this he performs a service which is often of great value to the maker. Needed cash is obtained immediately, because the whole issue of securities can thus be disposed of by a single transaction. And even where there is not immediate payment, the knowledge that the money will be provided when needed is often of paramount importance. By carrying securities in stock, the banker performs a service also to investors, who are thereby enabled to buy securities at such times as they desire.
   </p>
   <p>
   Whenever makers of securities or investors require all or any of these three services, the investment banker is needed, and payment of compensation to him is proper. Where there is no such need, the banker is clearly superfluous. And in respect to the original issue of many of our state and municipal bonds, and of some corporate securities, no such need exists.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Where the Banker Serves Not
   </h2>
   <p>
   It needs no banker experts in value to tell us that bonds of Massachusetts or New York, of Boston, Philadelphia or Baltimore and of scores of lesser American cities, are safe investments. The basic financial facts in regard to such bonds are a part of the common knowledge of many American investors; and, certainly, of most possible investors who reside in the particular state or city whose bonds are in question. Where the financial facts are not generally known, they are so simple, that they can be easily summarized and understood by any prospective investor without interpretation by an expert. Bankers often employ, before purchasing securities, their own accountants to verify the statements supplied by the makers of the security, and use these accountants' certificates as an aid in selling. States and municipalities, the makers of the securities, might for the same purpose employ independent public accountants of high reputation, who would give their certificates for use in marketing the securities. Investors could also be assured without banker-aid that the basic legal conditions are sound. Bankers, before purchasing an issue of securities, customarily obtain from their own counsel an opinion as to its legality, which investors are invited to examine. It would answer the same purpose, if states and municipalities should supplement the opinion of their legal representatives by that of independent counsel of recognized professional standing, who would certify to the legality of the issue.
   </p>
   <p>
   Neither should an investment banker be needed to find investors willing to take up, in small lots, a new issue of bonds of New York or Massachusetts, of Boston, Philadelphia or Baltimore, or a hundred other American cities. A state or municipality seeking to market direct to the investor its own bonds would naturally experience, at the outset, some difficulty in marketing a large issue. And in a newer community, where there is little accumulation of unemployed capital, it might be impossible to find buyers for any large issue. Investors are apt to be conservative; and they have been trained to regard the intervention of the banker as necessary. The bankers would naturally discourage any attempt of states and cities to dispense with their services. Entrance upon a market, hitherto monopolized by them, would usually have to be struggled for. But banker-fed investors, as well as others could, in time, be brought to realize the advantage of avoiding the middleman and dealing directly with responsible borrowers. Governments, like private concerns, would have to do educational work; but this publicity would be much less expensive and much more productive than that undertaken by the bankers. Many investors are already impatient of banker exactions; and eager to deal directly with governmental agencies in whom they have more confidence. And a great demand could, at once, be developed among smaller investors whom the bankers have been unable to interest, and who now never buy state or municipal bonds. The opening of this new field would furnish a market, in some respects more desirable and certainly wider than that now reached by the bankers.
   </p>
   <p>
   Neither do states or cities ordinarily need the services of the investment banker to carry their bonds pending distribution to the investor. Where there is immediate need for large funds, states and cities—at least the older communities—should be able to raise the money temporarily, quite as well as the bankers do now, while awaiting distribution of their bonds to the investor. Bankers carry the bonds with other people's money, not with their own. Why should not cities get the temporary use of other people's money as well? Bankers have the preferential use of the deposits in the banks, often because they control the banks. Free these institutions from banker-control, and no applicant to borrow the people's money will be received with greater favor than our large cities. Boston, with its $1,500,000,000 of assessed valuation and $78,033,128 net debt, is certainly as good a risk as even Lee, Higginson & Co. or Kidder, Peabody & Co.
   </p>
   <p>
   But ordinarily cities do not, or should not, require large sums of money at any one time. Such need of large sums does not arise except from time to time where maturing loans are to be met, or when some existing public utility plant is to be taken over from private owners. Large issues of bonds for any other purpose are usually made in anticipation of future needs, rather than to meet present necessities. Modern efficient public financiering, through substituting serial bonds for the long term issues (which in Massachusetts has been made obligatory) will, in time, remove the need of large sums at one time for paying maturing debts, since each year's maturities will be paid from the year's taxes. Purchases of existing public utility plants are of rare occurrence, and are apt to be preceded by long periods of negotiation. When they occur they can, if foresight be exercised, usually be financed without full cash payment at one time.
   </p>
   <p>
   Today, when a large issue of bonds is made, the banker, while ostensibly paying his own money to the city, actually pays to the city other people's money which he has borrowed from the banks. Then the banks get back, through the city's deposits, a large part of the money so received. And when the money is returned to the bank, the banker has the opportunity of borrowing it again for other operations. The process results in double loss to the city. The city loses by not getting from the banks as much for its bonds as investors would pay. And then it loses interest on the money raised before it is needed. For the bankers receive from the city bonds bearing rarely less than 4 per cent. interest; while the proceeds are deposited in the banks which rarely allow more than 2 per cent. interest on the daily balances.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Cities That Have Helped Themselves
   </h2>
   <p>
   In the present year some cities have been led by necessity to help themselves. The bond market was poor. Business was uncertain, money tight and the ordinary investor reluctant. Bankers were loth to take new bond issues. Municipalities were unwilling to pay the high rates demanded of them. And many cities were prohibited by law or ordinance from paying more than 4 per cent. interest; while good municipal bonds were selling on a 4 1/2 to 5 per cent. basis. But money had to be raised, and the attempt was made to borrow it direct from the lenders instead of from the banker-middleman. Among the cities which raised money in this way were Philadelphia, Baltimore, St. Paul, and Utica, New York.
   </p>
   <p>
   Philadelphia, under Mayor Blankenburg's inspiration, sold nearly $4,175,000 in about two days on a 4 per cent. basis and another "over-the-counter" sale has been made since. In Baltimore, with the assistance of theSun, $4,766,000 were sold "over the counter" on a 4 1/2 per cent. basis. Utica's two "popular sales" of 4 1/2 per cent. bonds were largely "over-subscribed." And since then other cities large and small have had their "over-the-counter"' bond sales. The experience of Utica, as stated by its Controller, Fred G. Reusswig, must prove of general interest:
   </p>
   <p>
   "In June of the present year I advertised for sale two issues, one of $100,000, and the other of $19,000, bearing interest at 4 1/2 per cent. The latter issue was purchased at par by a local bidder and of the former we purchased $10,000 for our sinking funds. That left $90,000 unsold, for which there were no bidders, which was the first time that I had been unable to sell our bonds. About this time the ‘popular sales’ of Baltimore and Philadelphia attracted my attention. The laws in effect in those cities did not restrict the officials as does our law and I could not copy their methods. I realized that there was plenty of money in this immediate vicinity and if I could devise a plan conforming with our laws under which I could make the sale attractive to small investors it would undoubtedly prove successful. I had found, in previous efforts to interest people of small means, that they did not understand the meaning of premium and would rather not buy than bid above par. They also objected to making a deposit with their bids. In arranging for the ‘popular sales’ I announced in the papers that, while I must award to the highest bidder, it was my opinion that a par bid would bethe highest bid. I also announced that we would issue bonds in denominations as low as $100 and that we would not require a deposit except where the bid was $5,000 or over. Then I succeeded in getting the local papers to print editorials and local notices upon the subject of municipal bonds, with particular reference to those of Utica and the forthcoming sale. All the prospective purchaser had to do was to fill in the amount desired, sign his name, seal the bid and await the day for the award. I did not have many bidders for very small amounts. There was only one for $100 at the first sale and one for $100 at the second sale and not more than ten who wanted less than $500. Most of the bidders were looking for from $1,000 to $5,000, but nearly all were people of comparatively small means, and with some the investment represented all their savings. In awarding the bonds I gave preference to residents of Utica and I had no difficulty in apportioning the various maturities in a satisfactory way.
   </p>
   <p>
   "I believe that there are a large number of persons in every city who would buy their own bonds if the way were made easier by law. Syracuse and the neighboring village of Ilion, both of which had been unable to sell in the usual way, came to me for a program of procedure and both have since had successful sales along similar lines. We have been able by this means to keep the interest rate on our bonds at 4 1/2 per cent., while cities which have followed the old plan of relying upon bond houses have had to increase the rate to 5 per cent. I am in favor of amending the law in such a manner that the Common Council, approved by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, may fix the prices at which bonds shall be sold, instead of calling for competitive bids. Then place the bonds on sale at the Controller's office to any one who will pay the price. The prices upon each issue should be graded according to the different values of different maturities. Under the present law, as we have it, conditions are too complicated to make a sale practicable except upon a basis of par bids.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   The St. Paul Experiment
   </h2>
   <p>
   St. Paul wisely introduced into its experiment a more democratic feature, which Tom L. Johnson, Cleveland's great mayor, thought out (but did not utilize), and which his friend W. B. Colver, now Editor-in-Chief of theDaily News, brought to the attention of the St. Paul officials. Mayor Johnson had recognized the importance of reaching the small savings of the people; and concluded that it was necessary not only to issue the bonds in very small denominations, but also to make them redeemable at par. He sought to combine practically, bond investment with the savings bank privilege. The fact that municipal bonds are issuable ordinarily only in large denominations, say, $1,000, presented an obstacle to be overcome. Mayor Johnson's plan was to have the sinking fund commissioners take large blocks of the bonds, issue against them certificates in denominations of $10, and have the commissioners agree (under their power to purchase securities) to buy the certificates back at par and interest. Savings bank experience, he insisted, showed that the redemption feature would not prove an embarrassment; as the percentage of those wishing to withdraw their money is small; and deposits are nearly always far in excess of withdrawals.
   </p>
   <p>
   The St. Paul sinking fund commissioners and City Attorney O'Neill approved the Johnson plan; and in the face of high money rates, sold on a 4 per cent. basis, during July, certificates to the net amount of $502,300; during August, $147,000; and during September, over $150,000, the average net sales being about $5,700 a day. Mr. Colver, reporting on the St. Paul experience, said:
   </p>
   <p>
   "There have been about 2,000 individual purchasers making the average deposit about $350 or $360. There have been no certificates sold to banks. During the first month the deposits averaged considerably higher and for this reason: in very many cases people who had savings which represented the accumulation of considerable time, withdrew their money from the postal savings banks, from the regular banks, from various hiding places and deposited them with the city. Now these same people are coming once or twice a month and making deposits of ten or twenty dollars, so that the average of the individual deposit has fallen very rapidly during September and every indication is that the number of small deposits will continue to increase and the relatively large deposits become less frequent as time goes on.
   </p>
   <p>
   "As a matter of fact, these certificate deposits are stable, far more than the deposits and investments of richer people who watch for advantageous reinvestments and who shift their money about rather freely. The man with three or four hundred dollars savings will suffer almost anything before he will disturb that fund. We believe that the deposits every day here, day in and day out, will continue to take care of all the withdrawals and still leave a net gain for the day, that net figure at present being about $5,700 a day.”
   </p>
   <p>
   Many cities are now prevented from selling bonds direct to the small investors, through laws which compel bonds to be issued in large denominations or which require the issue to be offered to the highest bidder. These legislative limitations should be promptly removed.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Salesmanship and Education
   </h2>
   <p>
   Such success as has already been attained is largely due to the unpaid educational work of leading progressive newspapers. But the educational work to be done must not be confined to teaching "the people"—the buyers of the bonds. Municipal officials and legislators have quite as much to learn. They must, first of all, study salesmanship. Selling bonds to the people is a new art, still undeveloped. The general problems have not yet been worked out. And besides these problems common to all states and cities, there will be, in nearly every community, local problems which must be solved, and local difficulties which must be overcome. The proper solution even of the general problems must take considerable time. There will have to be many experiments made; and doubtless there will be many failures. Every great distributor of merchandise knows the obstacles which he had to overcome before success was attained; and the large sums that had to be invested in opening and preparing a market. Individual concerns have spent millions in wise publicity; and have ultimately reaped immense profits when the market was won. Cities must take their lessons from these great distributors. Cities must be ready to study the problems and to spend prudently for proper publicity work. It might, in the end, prove an economy, even to allow, on particular issues, where necessary, a somewhat higher interest rate than bankers would exact, if thereby a direct market for bonds could be secured. Future operations would yield large economies. And the obtaining of a direct market for city bonds is growing ever more important, because of the huge increase in loans which must attend the constant expansion of municipal functions. In 1898 the new municipal issues aggregated $103,084,793; in 1912, $380,810,287.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Savings Banks as Customers
   </h2>
   <p>
   In New York, Massachusetts and the other sixteen states where a system of purely mutual savings banks is general, it is possible, with a little organization, to develop an important market for the direct purchaser of bonds. The bonds issued by Massachusetts cities and towns have averaged recently about $15,000,000 a year, and those of the state about $3,000,000. The 194 Massachusetts savings banks, with aggregate assets of $902,105,755.94, held on October 31, 1912, $90,536,581.32 in bonds and notes of states and municipalities. Of this sum about $60,000,000 are invested in bonds and notes of Massachusetts cities and towns, and about $8,000,000 in state issues. The deposits in the savings banks are increasing at the rate of over $30,000,000 a year. Massachusetts state and municipal bonds have, within a few years, come to be issued tax exempt in the hands of the holder, whereas other classes of bonds usually held by savings banks are subject to a tax of one-half of one per cent. of the market value. Massachusetts savings banks, therefore, will to an increasing extent, select Massachusetts municipal issues for high-grade bond investments. Certainly Massachusetts cities and towns might, with the cooperation of the Commonwealth, easily develop a "home market" for "over-the-counter" bond business with the savings banks. And the savings banks of other states offer similar opportunities to their municipalities.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Cooperation
   </h2>
   <p>
   Bankers obtained their power through combination. Why should not cities and states by means of cooperation free themselves from the bankers? For by cooperation between the cities and the state, the direct marketing of municipal bonds could be greatly facilitated.
   </p>
   <p>
   Massachusetts has 33 cities, each with a population of over 12,000 persons; 71 towns each with a population of over 5,000; and 250 towns each with a population of less than 5,000. Three hundred and eight of these municipalities now have funded indebtedness outstanding. The aggregate net indebtedness is about $180,000,000. Every year about $15,000,000 of bonds and notes are issued by the Massachusetts cities and towns for the purpose of meeting new requirements and refunding old indebtedness. If these municipalities would cooperate in marketing securities, the market for the bonds of each municipality would be widened; and there would exist also a common market for Massachusetts municipal securities which would be usually well supplied, would receive proper publicity and would attract investors. Successful merchandising obviously involves carrying an adequate, well-assorted stock. If every city acts alone, in endeavoring to market its bonds direct, the city's bond-selling activity will necessarily be sporadic. Its ability to supply the investor will be limited by its own necessities for money. The market will also be limited to the bonds of the particular municipality. But if a state and its cities should cooperate, there could be developed a continuous and broad market for the sale of bonds "over-the-counter." The joint selling agency of over three hundred municipalities,—as in Massachusetts—would naturally have a constant supply of assorted bonds and notes which could be had in as small amounts as the investor might want to buy them. It would be a simple matter to establish such a joint selling agency by which municipalities, under proper regulation of, and aid from the state, would cooperate.
   </p>
   <p>
   And cooperation among the cities and with the state might serve in another important respect. These 354 Massachusetts municipalities carry in the aggregate large bank balances. Sometimes the balance carried by a city represents unexpended revenues; sometimes unexpended proceeds of loans. On these balances they usually receive from the banks 2 per cent. interest. The balances of municipalities vary like those of other depositors; one having idle funds, when another is in need. Why should not all of these cities and towns cooperate, making, say, the State their common banker, and supply each other with funds as farmers and laborers cooperate through credit unions? Then cities would get, instead of 2 per cent. on their balances, all their money was worth.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Commonwealth of Massachusetts holds now in its sinking and other funds nearly $30,000,000 of Massachusetts municipal securities, constituting nearly three-fourth of all securities held in these funds. Its annual purchases aggregate nearly $4,000,000. Its purchases direct from cities and towns have already exceeded $1,000,000 this year. It would be but a simple extension of the state's function to cooperate, as indicated, in a joint, Municipal Bond Selling Agency and Credit Union. It would be a distinct advance in the efficiency of state and municipal financing; and what is even more important, a long step toward the emancipation of the people from banker-control.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Corporate Self-Help
   </h2>
   <p>
   Strong corporations with established reputations, locally or nationally, could emancipate themselves from the banker in a similar manner. Public-service corporations in some of our leading cities could easily establish "over-the-counter" home markets for their bonds; and would be greatly aided in this by the supervision now being exercised by some state commissions over the issue of securities by such corporations. Such corporations would gain thereby not only in freedom from banker-control and exactions, but in the winning of valuable local support. The investor's money would be followed by his sympathy. In things economic, as well as in things political, wisdom and safety lie in direct appeals to the people.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Pennsylvania Railroad now relies largely upon its stockholders for new capital. But a corporation with its long-continued success and reputation for stability should have much wider financial support and should eliminate the banker altogether. With the 2,700 stations on its system, the Pennsylvania could, with a slight expense, create nearly as many avenues through which money would be obtainable to meet its growing needs.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Banker Protections
   </h2>
   <p>
   It may be urged that reputations often outlive the conditions which justify them, that outlived reputations are pitfalls to the investors; and that the investment banker is needed to guard him from such dangers. True; but when have the big bankers or their little satellites protected the people from such pitfalls?
   </p>
   <p>
   Was there ever a more be-bankered railroad than the New Haven? Was there ever a more banker-led community of investors than New England? Six years before the fall of that great system, the hidden dangers were pointed out to these banker-experts. Proof was furnished of the rotting timbers. The disaster-breeding policies were laid bare. The bankers took no action. Repeatedly, thereafter, the bankers' attention was called to the steady deterioration of the structure. The New Haven books disclose 11,481 stockholders who are residents of Massachusetts; 5,682 stockholders in Connecticut; 735 in Rhode Island; and 3,510 in New York. Of the New Haven stockholders 10,474 were women. Of the New Haven stockholders 10,222 were of such modest means that their holdings were from one to ten shares only. The investors were sorely in need of protection. The city directories disclose 146 banking houses in Boston, 26 in Providence, 33 in New Haven and Hartford, and 357 in New York City. But who, connected with those New England and New York banking houses, during the long years which preceded the recent investigation of the Interstate Commerce Commission, raised either voice or pen in protest against the continuous mismanagement of that great trust property or warned the public of the impending disaster? Some of the bankers sold their own stock holdings. Some bankers whispered to a few favored customers advice to dispose of New Haven stock. But not one banker joined those who sought to open the eyes of New England to the impending disaster and to avert it by timely measures. New England's leading banking houses were ready to "cooperate" with the New Haven management in taking generous commissions for marketing the endless supply of new securities; but they did nothing to protect the investors. Were these bankers blind? Or were they afraid to oppose the will of J. P. Morgan & Co.?
   </p>
   <p>
   Perhaps it is the banker who, most of all, needs the New Freedom.

   Chapter VII: Big Men and Little Business
   </h1>
   <p>
   J. P. Morgan & Co. declare, in their letter to the Pujo Committee, that "practically all the railroad and industrial development of this country has taken place initially through the medium of the great banking houses." That statement is entirely unfounded in fact. On the contrary nearly every such contribution to our comfort and prosperity was "initiated"withouttheir aid. The "great banking houses" came into relation with these enterprises, either after success had been attained, or upon "reorganization" after the possibility of success had been demonstrated, but the funds of the hardy pioneers, who had risked their all, were exhausted.
   </p>
   <p>
   This is true of our early railroads, of our early street railways, and of the automobile; of the telegraph, the telephone and the wireless; of gas and oil; of harvesting machinery, and of our steel industry; of textile, paper and shoe industries; and of nearly every other important branch of manufacture. Theinitiationof each of these enterprises may properly be characterized as "great transactions"; and the men who contributed the financial aid and business management necessary for their introduction are entitled to share, equally with inventors, in our gratitude for what has been accomplished. But the instances are extremely rare where the original financing of such enterprises was undertaken by investment bankers, great or small. It was usually done by some common business man, accustomed to taking risks; or by some well-to-do friend of the inventor or pioneer, who was influenced largely by considerations other than money-getting. Here and there you will find that banker-aid was given; but usually in those cases it was a small local banking concern, not a "great banking house"' which helped to "initiate" the undertaking.

   <h2>
   Railroads
   </h2>
   <p>
   We have come to associate the great bankers with railroads. But their part was not conspicuous in the early history of the Eastern railroads; and in the Middle West the experience was, to some extent, similar.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Boston & Maine Railroad owns and leases 2,215 miles of line; but it is a composite of about 166 separate railroad companies. The New Haven Railroad owns and leases 1,996 miles of line; but it is a composite of 112 separate railroad companies. The necessary capital to build these little roads was gathered together, partly through state, county or municipal aid; partly from business men or landholders who sought to advance their special interests; partly from investors; and partly from well-to-do public-spirited men, who wished to promote the welfare of their particular communities. About seventy-five years after the first of these railroads was built, J. P. Morgan & Co. became fiscal agent for all of them by creating the New Haven-Boston & Maine monopoly.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Steamships
   </h2>
   <p>
   The history of our steamship lines is similar. In 1807, Robert Fulton, with the financial aid of Robert R. Livingston, a judge and statesman—not a banker— demonstrated with the Claremont, that it was practicable to propel boats by steam. In 1833 the three Cunard brothers of Halifax and 232 other persons—stockholders of the Quebec and Halifax Steam Navigation Company—joined in supplying about $80,000 to build the Royal William, the first steamer to cross the Atlantic. In 1902, many years after individual enterprises had developed practically all the great ocean lines, J. P. Morgan & Co. floated the International Mercantile Marine with its $52,744,000 of 4 1/2 bonds, now selling at about 60, and $100,000,000 of stock (preferred and common) on which no dividend has ever been paid. It was just sixty-two years after the first regular line of transatlantic steamers—the Cunard—was founded that Mr. Morgan organized the Shipping Trust.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Telegraph
   </h2>
   <p>
   The story of the telegraph is similar. The money for developing Morse's invention was supplied by his partner and co-worker, Alfred Vail. The initial line (from Washington to Baltimore) was built with an appropriation of $30,000 made by Congress in 1843. Sixty-six years later J. P. Morgan & Co. became bankers for the Western Union through financing its purchase by the American Telephone & Telegraph Company.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Harvesting Machinery
   </h2>
   <p>
   Next to railroads and steamships, harvesting machinery has probably been the most potent factor in the development of America; and most important of the harvesting machines was Cyrus H. McCormick's reaper. That made it possible to increase the grain harvest twenty- or thirty-fold. No investment banker had any part in introducing this great business man's invention.
   </p>
   <p>
   McCormick was without means; but William Butler Ogden, a railroad builder, ex-Mayor and leading citizen of Chicago, supplied $25,000 with which the first factory was built there in 1847. Fifty-five years later; J. P. Morgan & Co. performed the service of combining the five great harvester companies, and received a commission of $3,000,000. The concerns then consolidated as the International Harvester Company, with a capital stock of $120,000,000, had, despite their huge assets and earning power, been previously capitalized, in the aggregate, at only $10,500,000—strong evidence that in all the preceding years no investment banker had financed them. Indeed, McCormick was as able in business as in mechanical invention. Two years after Ogden paid him $25,000 for a half interest in the business, McCormick bought it back for $50,000; and thereafter, until his death in 1884, no one but members of the McCormick family had any interest in the business.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Banker Era
   </h2>
   <p>
   It may be urged that railroads and steamships, the telegraph and harvesting machinery were introduced before the accumulation of investment capital had developed the investment banker, and before America's "great banking houses" had been established; and that, consequently, it would be fairer to inquire what services bankers had rendered in connection with later industrial development. The firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. is fifty-five years old; Kuhn, Loeb & Co. fifty-six years old; Lee, Higginson & Co. over fifty years; and Kidder, Peabody & Co. forty-eight years; and yet the investment banker seems to have had almost as little part in "initiating" the great improvements of the last half century, as did bankers in the earlier period.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Steel
   </h2>
   <p>
   The modern steel industry of America, is forty-five years old. The "great bankers" had no part in initiating it. Andrew Carnegie, then already a man of large means, introduced the Bessemer process in 1868. In the next thirty years our steel and iron industry increased greatly. By 1898 we had far outstripped all competitors. America's production about equalled the aggregate of England and Germany. We had also reduced costs so much that Europe talked of the "American Peril." It was 1898, when J. P. Morgan & Co. took their first step in forming the Steel Trust, by organizing the Federal Steel Company. Then followed the combination of the tube mills into an $80,000,000 corporation, J. P. Morgan & Co. taking for their syndicate services $20,000,000 of common stock. About the same time the consolidation of the bridge and structural works, the tin plate, the sheet steel, the hoop and other mills followed; and finally, in 1901, the Steel Trust was formed, with a capitalization of $1,402,000,000. These combinations came thirty years after the steel industry had been "initiated”.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Telephone
   </h2>
   <p>
   The telephone industry is less than forty years old. It is probably America's greatest contribution to industrial development. The bankers had no part in "initiating" it. The glory belongs to a simple, enthusiastic, warm-hearted, business man of Haverhill, Massachusetts, who was willing to riskhis ownmoney. H. N. Casson tells of this, most interestingly, in his "History of the Telephone”:
   </p>
   <p>
   "The only man who had money and dared to stake it on the future of the telephone was Thomas Sanders, and he did this not mainly for business reasons. Both he and Hubbard were attached to Bell primarily by sentiment, as Bell had removed the blight of dumbness from Sanders' little son, and was soon to marry Hubbard's daughter. Also, Sanders had no expectation, at first, that so much money would be needed. He was not rich. His entire business, which was that of cutting out soles for shoe manufacturers, was not at any time worth more than thirty-five thousand dollars. Yet, from 1874 to 1878, he had advanced nine-tenths of the money that was spent on the telephone. The first five thousand telephones, and more, were made with his money. And so many long, expensive months dragged by before any relief came to Sanders, that he was compelled, much against his will and his business judgment, to stretch his credit within an inch of the breaking-point to help Bell and the telephone. Desperately he signed note after note until he faced a total of one hundred and ten thousand dollars. If the new 'scientific toy' succeeded, which he often doubted, he would be the richest citizen in Haverhill; and if it failed, which he sorely feared, he would be a bankrupt. Sanders and Hubbard were leasing telephones two by two, to business men who previously had been using the private lines of the Western Union Telegraph Company. This great corporation was at this time their natural and inevitable enemy. It had swallowed most of its competitors, and was reaching out to monopolize all methods of communication by wire. The rosiest hope that shone in front of Sanders and Hubbard was that the Western Union might conclude to buy the Bell patents, just as it had already bought many others. In one moment of discouragement they had offered the telephone to President Orton, of the Western Union, for $100,000; and Orton had refused it. ‘What use,’ he asked pleasantly, ‘could this company make of an electrical toy?’
   </p>
   <p>
   "But besides the operation of its own wires, the Western Union was supplying customers with various kinds of printing-telegraphs and dial-telegraphs, some of which could transmit sixty words a minute. These accurate instruments, it believed, could never be displaced by such a scientific oddity as the telephone, and it continued to believe this until one of its subsidiary companies—the Gold and Stock—reported that several of its machines had been superseded by telephones.
   </p>
   <p>
   "At once the Western Union awoke from its indifference. Even this tiny nibbling at its business must be stopped. It took action quickly, and organized the ‘American Speaking-Telephone Company,’ and with $300,000 capital, and with three electrical inventors, Edison, Gray, and Dolbear, on its staff. With all the bulk of its great wealth and prestige, it swept down upon Bell and his little body-guard. It trampled upon Bell's patent with as little concern as an elephant can have when he tramples upon an ant's nest. To the complete bewilderment of Bell, it coolly announced that it had the only original telephone, and that it was ready to supply superior telephones with all the latest improvements made by the original inventors—Dolbear, Gray, and Edison.
   </p>
   <p>
   "The result was strange and unexpected. The Bell group, instead of being driven from the field, were at once lifted to a higher level in the business world. And the Western Union, in the endeavor to protect its private lines, became involuntarily a ‘bell-wether’ to lead capitalists in the direction of the telephone.’'
   </p>
   <p>
   Even then, when financial aid came to the Bell enterprise, it was from capitalists, not from bankers, and among these capitalists was William H. Forbes (son of the builder of the Burlington) who became the first President of the Bell Telephone Company. That was in 1878. More than twenty years later, after the telephone had spread over the world, the great house of Morgan came into financial control of the property. The American Telephone & Telegraph Company was formed. The process of combination became active. Since January, 1900, its stock has increased from $25,886,300 to $344,606,400. In six years (1906 to 1912) the Morgan associates marketed about $300,000,000 bonds of that company or its subsidiaries. In that period the volume of business done by the telephone companies had, of course, grown greatly, and the plant had to be constantly increased; but the proceeds of these huge security issues were used, to a large extent, in effecting combinations; that is, in buying out telephone competitors; in buying control of the Western Union Telegraph Company; and in buying up outstanding stock interests in semi-independent Bell companies. It is these combinations which have led to the investigation of the Telephone Company by the Department of Justice; and they are, in large part, responsible for the movement to have the government take over the telephone business.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Electrical Machinery
   </h2>
   <p>
   The business of manufacturing electrical machinery and apparatus is only a little over thirty years old. J. P. Morgan & Co. became interested early in one branch of it; but their dominance of the business today is due, not to their "initiating" it, but to their effecting a combination, and organizing the General Electric Company in 1892. There were then three large electrical companies, the Thomson-Houston, the Edison and the Westinghouse, besides some small ones. The Thomson-Houston of Lynn, Massachusetts, was in many respects the leader, having been formed to introduce, among other things, important inventions of Prof. Elihu Thomson and Prof. Houston. Lynn is one of the principal shoe-manufacturing centers of America. It is within ten miles of State Street, Boston; but Thomson's early financial support came not from Boston bankers, but mainly from Lynn business men and investors; men active, energetic, and used to taking risks withtheir ownmoney. Prominent among them was Charles A. Coffin, a shoe manufacturer, who became connected with the Thomson-Houston Company upon its organization and president of the General Electric when Mr. Morgan formed that company in 1892, by combining the Thomson-Houston and the Edison. To his continued service, supported by other Thomson-Houston men in high positions, the great prosperity of the company is, in large part, due. The two companies so combined controlled probably one-half of all electrical patents then existing in America; and certainly more than half of those which had any considerable value.
   </p>
   <p>
   In 1896 the General Electric pooled its patents with the Westinghouse, and thus competition was further restricted. In 1903 the General Electric absorbed the Stanley Electric Company, its other large competitor; and became the largest manufacturer of electric apparatus and machinery in the world. In 1912 the resources of the Company were $131,942,144. It billed sales to the amount of $89,182,185. It employed directly over 60,000 persons,—more than a fourth as many as the Steel Trust. And it is protected against "undue" competition; for one of the Morgan partners has been a director, since 1909, in the Westinghouse; the only other large electrical machinery company in America.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Automobile
   </h2>
   <p>
   The automobile industry is about twenty years old. It is now America's most prosperous business. When Henry B. Joy, President of the Packard Motor Car Company, was asked to what extent the bankers aided in "initiating" the automobile, he replied:
   </p>
   <p>
   "It is the observable facts of history, it is also my experience of thirty years as a business man, banker, etc., that first the seer conceives an opportunity. He has faith in his almost second sight. He believes he can do something—develop a business—construct an industry—build a railroad—or Niagara Falls Power Company,—and make it pay !
   </p>
   <p>
   "Now the human measure is not the actual physical construction, but the `make it pay’!
   </p>
   <p>
   "A man raised the money in the late 90s and built a beet sugar factory in Michigan. Wiseacres said it was nonsense. He gathered together the money from his friends who would take a chance with him. He not only built the sugar factory (and there was never any doubt of his ability to do that) but he made it pay. The next year two more sugar factories were built, and were financially successful. These were built by private individuals of wealth, taking chances in the face of cries of doubting bankers and trust companies.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Once demonstrated that the industry was a sound one financially andthenbankers and trust companies would lend the new sugar companies which were speedily organized a large part of the necessary funds to construct and operate.
   </p>
   <p>
   "The motor-car business was the same.
   </p>
   <p>
   "When a few gentlemen followed me in my vision of the possibilities of the business, the banks and older business men (who in the main were the banks) said, ‘fools and their money soon to be parted’—etc., etc.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Private capital at first establishes an industry, backs it through its troubles, and, if possible, wins financial success when banks would not lend a dollar of aid.
   </p>
   <p>
   "The business once having proved to be practicable and financially successful, then do the banks lend aid to its needs.”
   </p>
   <p>
   Such also was the experience of the greatest of the many financial successes in the automobile industry—the Ford Motor Company.
   </p>
   <h2>
   How Bankers Arrest Development
   </h2>
   <p>
   But "great banking houses" have not merely failed to initiate industrial development; they have definitely arrested development because to them the creation of the trusts is largely due. The recital in the Memorial addressed to the President by the Investors' Guild in November, 1911, is significant:
   </p>
   <p>
   "It is a well-known fact that modern trade combinations tend strongly toward constancy of process and products, and by their very nature are opposed to new processes and new products originated by independent inventors, and hence tend to restrain competition in the development and sale of patents and patent rights; and consequently tend to discourage independent inventive thought, to the great detriment of the nation, and with injustice to inventors whom the Constitution especially intended to encourage and protect in their rights.”
   </p>
   <p>
   And more specific was the testimony of the Engineering News:
   </p>
   <p>
   "We are today something like five years behind Germany in iron and steel metallurgy, and such innovations as are being introduced by our iron and steel manufacturers are most of them merely following the lead set by foreigners years ago.
   </p>
   <p>
   "We do not believe this is because American engineers are any less ingenious or original than those of Europe, though they may indeed be deficient in training and scientific education compared with those of Germany. We believe the main cause is the wholesale consolidation which has taken place in American industry. A huge organization is too clumsy to take up the development of an original idea. With the market closely controlled and profits certain by following standard methods, those who control our trusts do not want the bother of developing anything new.
   </p>
   <p>
   "We instance metallurgy only by way of illustration: There are plenty of other fields of industry where exactly the same condition exists. We are building the same machines and using the same methods as a dozen years ago, and the real advances in the art are being made by European inventors and manufacturers.”
   </p>
   <p>
   To which President Wilson's statement may be added:
   </p>
   <p>
   "I am not saying that all invention had been stopped by the growth of trusts, but I think it is perfectly clear that invention in many fields has been discouraged, that inventors have been prevented from reaping the full fruits of their ingenuity and industry, and that mankind has been deprived of many comforts and conveniences, as well as the opportunity of buying at lower prices.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Do you know, have you had occasion to learn, that there is no hospitality for invention, now-a-days?”
   </p>
   <h2>
   Trusts and Financial Concentration
   </h2>
   <p>
   The fact that industrial monopolies arrest development is more serious even than the direct burden imposed through extortionate prices. But the most harm-bearing incident of the trusts is their promotion of financial concentration. Industrial trusts feed the money trust. Practically every trust created has destroyed the financial independence of some communities and of many properties; for it has centered the financing of a large part of whole lines of business in New York, and this usually with one of a few banking houses. This is well illustrated by the Steel Trust, which is a trust of trusts; that is, the Steel Trust combines in one huge holding company the trusts previously formed in the different branches of the steel business. Thus the Tube Trust combined 17 tube mills, located in 16 different cities, scattered over 5 states and owned by 13 different companies. The wire trust combined 19 mills; the sheet steel trust 26; the bridge and structural trust 27; and the tin plate trust 36; all scattered similarly over many states. Finally these and other companies were formed into the United States Steel Corporation, combining 228 companies in all, located in 127 cities and towns, scattered over 18 states. Before the combinations were effected, nearly every one of these companies was owned largely by those who managed it, and had been financed, to a large extent, in the place, or, in the state, in which it was located. When the Steel Trust was formed all these concerns came under one management. Thereafter, the financing of each of these 228 corporations (and some which were later acquired) had to be done through or with the consent of J. P. Morgan & Co.That was the greatest step in financial concentration ever taken.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Stock Exchange Incidents
   </h2>
   <p>
   The organization of trusts has served in another way to increase the power of the Money Trust. Few of the independent concerns out of which the trusts have been formed, were listed on the New York Stock Exchange; and few of them had financial offices in New York. Promoters of large corporations, whose stock is to be held by the public, and also investors, desire to have their securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Under the rules of the Exchange, no security can be so listed unless the corporation has a transfer agent and registrar in New York City. Furthermore, banker-directorships have contributed largely to the establishment of the financial offices of the trusts in New York City. That alone would tend to financial concentration. But the listing of the stock enhances the power of the Money Trust in another way. An industrial stock, once listed, frequently becomes the subject of active speculation; and speculation feeds the Money Trust indirectly in many ways. It draws the money of the country to New York. The New York bankers handle the loans of other people's money on the Stock Exchange; and members of the Stock Exchange receive large amounts from commissions. For instance: There are 5,084,952 shares of United States Steel common stock outstanding. But in the five years ending December 31, 1912, speculation in that stock was so extensive that there were sold on the Exchange an average of 29,380,888 shares a year; or nearly six times as much as there is Steel common in existence. Except where the transactions are by or for the brokers, sales on the Exchange involve the payment of twenty-five cents in commission for each share of stock sold; that is, twelve and one-half cents by the seller and twelve and one-half cents by the buyer. Thus the commission from the Steel common alone afforded a revenue averaging many millions a year. The Steel preferred stock is also much traded in; and there are 138 other industrials, largely trusts, listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Trust Ramifications
   </h2>
   <p>
   But the potency of trusts as a factor in financial concentration is manifested in still other ways; notably through their ramifying operations. This is illustrated forcibly by the General Electric Company's control of water-power companies which has now been disclosed in an able report of the United States Bureau of Corporations:
   </p>
   <p>
   "The extent of the General Electric influence is not fully revealed by its consolidated balance sheet. A very large number of corporations are connected with it through its subsidiaries and through corporations controlled by these subsidiaries or affiliated with them. There is a still wider circle of influence due to the fact that officers and directors of the General Electric Co. and its subsidiaries are also officers or directors of many other corporations, some of whose securities are owned by the General Electric Company.
   </p>
   <p>
   "The General Electric Company holds in the first place all the common stock in three security holding companies: the United Electric Securities Co., the Electrical Securities Corporation, and the Electric Bond and Share Co. Directly and through these corporations and their officers the General Electric controls a large part of the water power of the United States.
   </p>
   <p>
   . . ."The water-power companies in the General Electric group are found in 18 States. These 18 States have 2,325,757 commercial horsepower developed or under construction, and of this total the General Electric group includes 939,115 h. p. or 40.4 per cent. The greatest amount of power controlled by the companies in the General Electric group in any State is found in Washington. This is followed by New York, Pennsylvania, California, Montana, Iowa, Oregon, and Colorado. In five of the States shown in the table the water-power companies included in the General Electric group control more than 50 per cent. of the commercial power, developed and under construction. The percentage of power in the States included in the General Electric group ranges from a little less than 2 per cent. in Michigan to nearly 80 per cent. in Pennsylvania. In Colorado they control 72 per cent.; in New Hampshire 61 per cent.; in Oregon 58 per cent.; and in Washington 55 per cent.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Besides the power developed and under construction water-power concerns included in the General Electric group own in the States shown in the table 641,600 h. p. undeveloped.”
   </p>
   <p>
   This water power control enables the General Electric group to control other public service corporations:
   </p>
   <p>
   "The water-power companies subject to General Electric influence control the street railways in at least 16 cities and towns; the electric-light plants in 78 cities and towns; gas plants in 19 cities and towns; and are affiliated with the electric light and gas plants in other towns. Though many of these communities, particularly those served with light only, are small, several of them are the most important in the States where these water-power companies operate. The water-power companies in the General Electric group own, control, or are closely affiliated with, the street railways in Portland and Salem, Ore.; Spokane, Wash.; Great Falls, Mont. ; St. Louis, Mo. ; Winona, Minn.; Milwaukee and Racine, Wis.; Elmira, N. Y.; Asheville and Raleigh, N. C., and other relatively less important towns. The towns in which the lighting plants (electric or gas) are owned or controlled include Portland, Salem, Astoria, and other towns in Oregon; Bellingham and other towns in Washington; Butte, Great Falls, Bozeman and other towns in Montana; Leadville and Colorado Springs in Colorado; St. Louis, Mo. ; Milwaukee, Racine and several small towns in Wisconsin; Hudson and Rensselaer, N. Y.; Detroit, Mich. ; Asheville and Raleigh, N. C.; and in fact one or more towns in practically every community where developed water power is controlled by this group. In addition to the public-service corporations thus controlled by the water-power companies subject to General Electric influence, there are numerous public-service corporations in other municipalities that purchase power from the hydroelectric developments controlled by or affiliated with the General Electric Co. This is true of Denver, Colo., which has already been discussed. In Baltimore, Md., a water-power concern in the General Electric group, namely, the Pennsylvania Water & Power Co., sells 20,000 h. p. to the Consolidated Gas, Electric Light & Power Co., which controls the entire light and power business of that city. The power to operate all the electric street railway systems of Buffalo, N. Y., and vicinity, involving a trackage of approximately 375 miles, is supplied through a subsidiary of the Niagara Falls Power Co.”
   </p>
   <p>
   And the General Electric Company, through the financing of public service companies, exercises a like influence in communities where there is no water power:
   </p>
   <p>
   "It, or its subsidiaries, has acquired control of or an interest in the public-service corporations of numerous cities where there is no water-power connection, and it is affiliated with still others by virtue of common directors… This vast network of relationship between hydro-electric corporations through prominent officers and directors of the largest manufacturer of electrical machinery and supplies in the United States is highly significant. . .
   </p>
   <p>
   "It is possible that this relationship to such a large number of strong financial concerns, through common officers and directors, affords the General Electric Co. an advantage that may place rivals at a corresponding disadvantage. Whether or not this great financial power has been used to the particular disadvantage of any rival water-power concern is not so important as the fact that such power exists and that it might be so used at any time.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Sherman Law
   </h2>
   <p>
   The Money Trust cannot be broken, if we allow its power to be constantly augmented. To break the Money Trust, we must stop that power at its source. The industrial trusts are among its most effective feeders. Those which are illegal should be dissolved. The creation of new ones should be prevented. To this end the Sherman Law should be supplemented both by providing more efficient judicial machinery, and by creating a commission with administrative functions to aid in enforcing the law. When that is done, another step will have been taken toward securing the New Freedom. But restrictive legislation alone will not suffice. We should bear in mind the admonition with which the Commissioner of Corporations closes his review of our water power development:
   </p>
   <p>
   "There is . . . presented such a situation in water powers and other public utilities as might bring about at any time under a single management the control of a majority of the developed, water power in the United States and similar control over the public utilities in a vast number of cities and towns, including some of the most important in the country.”
   </p>
   <p>
   We should conserve all rights which the Federal Government and the States now have in our natural resources, and there should be a complete separation of our industries from railroads and public utilities.
   </p>
   <h1>
   Chapter VIII: A Curse of Bigness
   </h1>
   <p>
   Bigness has been an important factor in the rise of the Money Trust: Big railroad systems, Big industrial trusts, big public service companies; and as instruments of these Big banks and Big trust companies. J. P. Morgan & Co. (in their letter of defence to the Pujo Committee) urge the needs of Big Business as the justification for financial concentration. They declare that what they euphemistically call "cooperation" is "simply a further result of the necessity for handling great transactions"; that "the country obviously requires not only the larger individual banks, but demands also that those banks shall cooperate to perform efficiently the country's business"; and that "a step backward along this line would mean a halt in industrial progress that would affect every wage-earner from the Atlantic to the Pacific." The phrase "great transactions" is used by the bankers apparently as meaning large corporate security issues.
   </p>
   <p>
   Leading bankers have undoubtedly cooperated during the last 15 years in floating some very large security issues, as well as many small ones. But relatively few large issues were made necessary by great improvements undertaken or by industrial development. Improvements and development ordinarily proceed slowly. For them, even where the enterprise involves large expenditures, a series of smaller issues is usually more appropriate than single large ones. This is particularly true in the East where the building of new railroads has practically ceased. The "great" security issues in which bankers have cooperated were, with relatively few exceptions, made either for the purpose of effecting combinations or, as a consequence of such combinations. Furthermore, the combinations which made necessary these large security issues or underwritings were, in most cases, either contrary to existing statute law, or contrary to laws recommended by the Interstate Commerce Commission, or contrary to the laws of business efficiency. So both the financial concentration and the combinations which they have served were, in the main, against the public interest. Size, we are told, is not a crime. But size may, at least, become noxious by reason of the means through which it was attained or the uses to which it is put. And it is size attained by combination, instead of natural growth, which has contributed so largely to our financial concentration. Let us examine a few cases:
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Harriman Pacifics
   </h2>
   <p>
   J. P. Morgan & Co., in urging the "need of large banks and the cooperation of bankers," said:
   </p>
   <p>
   "The Attorney-General's recent approval of the Union Pacific settlement calls for a single commitment on the part of bankers of $126,000,000.”
   </p>
   <p>
   This $126,000,000 "commitment" was not made to enable the Union Pacific to secure capital. On the contrary it was a guaranty that it would succeed in disposing of its Southern Pacific stock to that amount. And when it had disposed of that stock, it was confronted with the serious problem—what to do with the proceeds? This huge underwriting became necessary solely because the Union Pacific had violated the Sherman Law. It had acquired that amount of Southern Pacific stock illegally; and the Supreme Court of the United States finally decreed that the illegality cease. This same illegal purchase had been the occasion, twelve years earlier, of another "great transaction,"—the issue, of a $100,000,000 of Union Pacific bonds, which were sold to provide funds for acquiring this Southern Pacific and other stocks in violation of law. Bankers "cooperated" also to accomplish that.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Union Pacific Improvements
   </h2>
   <p>
   The Union Pacific and its auxiliary lines (the Oregon Short Line, the Oregon Railway and Navigation and the Oregon-Washington Railroad) made, in the fourteen years, ending June 30, 1912, issues of securities aggregating $375,158,183 (of which $46,500,000 were refunded or redeemed) ; but the large security issues served mainly to supply funds for engaging in illegal combinations or stock speculation. The extraordinary improvements and additions that raised the Union Pacific Railroad to a high state of efficiency were provided mainly by the net earnings from the operation of its railroads. And note how great the improvements and additions were: Tracks were straightened, grades were lowered, bridges were rebuilt, heavy rails were laid, old equipment was replaced by new; and the cost of these was charged largely as operating expense. Additional equipment was added, new lines were built or acquired, increasing the system by 3524 miles of line, and still other improvements and betterments were made and charged to capital account. These expenditures aggregated $191,512,328. But it needed no "large security issues" to provide the capital thus wisely expended. The net earnings from the operations of these railroads were so large that nearly all these improvements and additions could have been made without issuing on the average more than $1,000,000 a year of additional securities for "new money," and the company still could have paid six per cent. dividends after 1906 (when that rate was adopted). For while $13,679,452 a year, on the average, was charged to Cost of Road and Equipment, the surplus net earnings and other funds would have yielded, on the average, $12,750,982 a year available for improvements and additions, without raising money on new security issues.
   </p>
   <h2>
   How the Security Proceeds Were Spent
   </h2>
   <p>
   The $375,000,000 securities (except to the extent of about $13,000,000 required for improvements, and the amounts applied for refunding and redemptions) were available to buy stocks and bonds of other companies. And some of the stocks so acquired were sold at large profits, providing further sums to be employed in stock purchases.
   </p>
   <p>
   The $375,000,000 Union Pacific Lines security issues, therefore, were not needed to supply funds for Union Pacific improvements; nor did these issues supply funds for the improvement of any of the companies in which the Union Pacific invested (except that certain amounts were advanced later to aid in financing the Southern Pacific).They served, substantially, no purpose save to transfer the ownership of railroad stocks from one set of persons to another.
   </p>
   <p>
   Here are some of the principal investments:
   </p>
   <p>
   1. $91,657,500, in acquiring and financing the Southern Pacific.
   </p>
   <p>
   2. $89,391,401, in acquiring the Northern Pacific stock and stock of the Northern Securities Co.
   </p>
   <p>
   3. $45,466,960, in acquiring Baltimore & Ohio. stock.
   </p>
   <p>
   4. $37,692,256, in acquiring Illinois Central stock.
   </p>
   <p>
   5. $23,205,679, in acquiring New York Central stock.
   </p>
   <p>
   6. $10,395,000, in acquiring Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe stock.
   </p>
   <p>
   7. $8,946,781, in acquiring Chicago & Alton stock.
   </p>
   <p>
   8. $11,610,187, in acquiring Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul stock.
   </p>
   <p>
   9. $6,750,423, in acquiring Chicago & Northwestern stock.
   </p>
   <p>
   10. $6,936,696, in acquiring Railroad Securities Co. stock (Illinois Central stock).
   </p>
   <p>
   The immediate effect of these stock acquisitions, as stated by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1907, was merely this:
   </p>
   <p>
   "Mr. Harriman may journey by steamship from New York to New Orleans, thence by rail to San Francisco, across the Pacific Ocean to China, and, returning by another route to the United States, may go to Ogden by any one of three rail lines, and thence to Kansas City or Omaha, without leaving the deck or platform of a carrier which he controls, and without duplicating any part of his journey.
   </p>
   <p>
   "He has further what appears to be a dominant control in the Illinois Central Railroad running directly north from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes, parallel to the Mississippi River; and two thousand miles west of the Mississippi River he controls the only line of railroad parallel to the Pacific Coast, and running from the Colorado River to the Mexican border….
   </p>
   <p>
   "The testimony taken at this hearing shows that about fifty thousand square miles of territory in the State of Oregon, surrounded by the lines of the Oregon Short Line Railroad Company, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, and the Southern Pacific Company, is not developed. While the funds of those companies which could be used for that purpose are being invested in stocks like the New York Central and other lines having only a remote relation to the territory in which the Union Pacific System is located.”
   </p>
   <p>
   Mr. Harriman succeeded in becoming director in 27 railroads with 39,354 miles of line; and they extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific; from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Aftermath
   </h2>
   <p>
   On September 9, 1909, less than twelve years after Mr. Harriman first became a director in the Union Pacific, he died from overwork at the age of 61. But it was not death only that had set a limit to his achievements. The multiplicity of his interests prevented him from performing for his other railroads the great services that had won him a world-wide reputation as manager and rehabilitator of the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific. Within a few months after Mr. Harriman's death the serious equipment scandal on the Illinois Central became public, culminating in the probable suicide of one of the vice-presidents of that company. The Chicago & Alton (in the management of which Mr. Harriman was prominent from 1899 to 1907, as President, Chairman of the Board, or Executive Committeeman), has never regained the prosperity it enjoyed before he and his associates acquired control. The Père Marquette has passed again into receiver's hands. Long before Mr. Harriman’s death the Union Pacific had disposed of its Northern Pacific stock, because the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Northern Securities Company illegal, and dissolved the Northern Pacific-Great Northern merger. Three years after his death, the Supreme Court of the United States ordered the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger dissolved. By a strange irony, the law has permitted the Union Pacific to reap large profits from its illegal transactions in Northern Pacific and Southern Pacific stocks. But many other stocks held "as investments" have entailed large losses. Stocks in the Illinois Central and other companies which cost the Union Pacific $129,894,991.72, had on November 15, 1913, a market value of only $87,851,500; showing a shrinkage of $42,043,491.72 and the average income from them, while held, was only about 4.30 per cent. on their cost.
   </p>
   <h2>
   A Banker's Paradise
   </h2>
   <p>
   Kuhn, Loeb & Co. were the Union Pacific bankers. It was in pursuance of a promise which Mr. Jacob H. Schiff—the senior partner—had given, pending the reorganization, that Mr. Harriman first became a member of the Executive Committee in 1897. Thereafter combinations grew and crumbled, and there were vicissitudes in stock speculations. But the investment bankers prospered amazingly; and financial concentration proceeded without abatement. The bankers and their associates received the commissions paid for purchasing the stocks which the Supreme Court holds to have been acquired illegally—and have retained them. The bankers received commissions for underwriting the securities issued to raise the money with which to buy the stocks which the Supreme Court holds to have been illegally acquired, and have retained them. The bankers received commissions paid for floating securities of the controlled companies—while they were thus controlled in violation of law—and have, of course, retained them. Finally when, after years, a decree is entered to end the illegal combination, these same bankers are on hand to perform the services of undertaker—and receive further commissions for their banker-aid in enabling the law-breaking corporation to end its wrong doing and to comply with the decree of the Supreme Court. And yet, throughout nearly all this long period, both before and after Mr. Harriman's death, two partners in Kuhn, Loeb & Co. were directors or members of the executive committee of the Union Pacific; and as such must be deemed responsible with others for the illegal acts.
   </p>
   <p>
   Indeed, these bankers have not only received commissions for the underwritings of transactions accomplished, though illegal; they have received commissions also for merelyagreeingto underwrite a "great transaction" which the authorities would not permit to beaccomplished. The $126,000,000 underwriting (that "single commitment on the part of the bankers" to which J. P. Morgan & Co. refer as being called for by "the Attorney General's approval of the Union Pacific settlement") never became effective; because the Public Service Commission of California refused to approve the terms of settlement. But the Union Pacific, nevertheless, paid the Kuhn Loeb Syndicate a large underwriting fee for having been ready and willing "to serve" should the opportunity arise: and another underwriting commission was paid when the Southern Pacific stock was finally distributed, with the approval of Attorney General McReynolds, under the Court's decree. Thus the illegal purchase of Southern Pacific stock yielded directly four crops of commissions; two when it was acquired, and two when it was disposed of. And during the intervening period the illegally controlled Southern Pacific yielded many more commissions to the bankers. For the schedules filed with the Pujo Committee show that Kuhn, Loeb & Co. marketed, in addition to the Union Pacific securities above referred to, $334,000,000 of Southern Pacific and Central Pacific securities between 1903 and 1911.
   </p>
   <p>
   The aggregate amount of the commissions paid to these bankers in connection with Union Pacific-Southern Pacific transactions is not disclosed. It must have been very large; for not only were the transactions "great"; but the commissions were liberal. The Interstate Commerce Commission finds that bankers received about 5 per cent. on the purchase price for buying the first 750,000 shares of Southern Pacific stock; and the underwriting commission on the first $100,000,000 Union Pacific bonds issued to make that and other purchases was $5,000,000. How large the two underwriting commissions were which the Union Pacific paid in effecting the severance of this illegal merger, both the company and the bankers have declined to disclose. Furthermore the Interstate Commerce Commission showed, clearly, while investigating the Union Pacific's purchase of the Chicago & Alton stock, that the bankers' profits were by no means confined to commissions.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Burlington
   </h2>
   <p>
   Such railroad combinations produce injury to the public far more serious than the heavy tax of bankers' commissions and profits. For in nearly every case the absorption into a great system of a theretofore independent railroad has involved the loss of financial independence to some community, property or men, who thereby become subjects or satellites of the Money Trust. The passing of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, in 1901, to the Morgan associates, presents a striking example of this process.
   </p>
   <p>
   After the Union Pacific acquired the Southern Pacific stock in 1901, it sought control, also, of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy,—a most prosperous railroad, having then 7912 miles of line. The Great Northern and Northern Pacific recognized that Union Pacific control of the Burlington would exclude them from much of Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. The two northern roads, which were already closely allied with each other and with J. P. Morgan & Co., thereupon purchased for $215,227,000, of their joint 4 per cent. bonds, nearly all of the $109,324,000 (par value) outstanding Burlington stock. A struggle with the Union Pacific ensued which yielded soon to "harmonious cooperation." The Northern Securities Company was formed with $400,000,000 capital, thereby merging the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific and the Burlington, and joining the Harriman, Kuhn-Loeb, with the Morgan-Hill interests. Obviously neither the issue of $215,000,000 joint 4's, nor the issue of the $400,000,000 Northern Securities stock supplied one dollar of funds for improvements of, or additions to, any of the four great railroad systems concerned in these "large transactions." The sole effect of issuing $615,000,000 of securities was to transfer stock from one set of persons to another. And the resulting "harmonious cooperation" was soon interrupted by the government proceedings, which ended with the dissolution of the Northern Securities Company. But the evil done outlived the combination. The Burlington had passed forever from its independent Boston owners to the Morgan allies, who remain in control.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Burlington—one of Boston's finest achievements—was the creation of John M. Forbes. He was a builder; not a combiner, or banker, or wizard of finance. He was a simple, hard-working business man. He had been a merchant in China at a time when China's trade was among America's big business. He had been connected with shipping and with manufacturers. He had the imagination of the great merchant; the patience and perseverance of the great manufacturer; the courage of the sea-farer; and the broad view of the statesman. Bold, but never reckless; scrupulously careful of other people's money, he was ready, after due weighing of chances, to risk his own in enterprises promising success. He was in the best sense of the term, a great adventurer. Thus equipped, Mr. Forbes entered, in 1852, upon those railroad enterprises which later developed into the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy. Largely with his own money and that of friends who confided in him, he built these railroads and carried them through the panic of '57, when the "great banking houses" of those days lacked courage to assume the burdens of a struggling ill-constructed line, staggering under financial difficulties.
   </p>
   <p>
   Under his wise management, and that of the men whom he trained, the little Burlington became a great system. It was "built on honor," and managed honorably. It weathered every other great financial crisis, as it did that of 1857. It reached maturity without a reorganization or the sacrifice of a single stockholder or bondholder.
   </p>
   <p>
   Investment bankers had no place on the Burlington Board of Directors; nor had the banker-practice, of being on both sides of a bargain. "I am unwilling," said Mr. Forbes, early in his career, "to run the risk of having the imputation of buying from a company in which I am interested." About twenty years later he made his greatest fight to rescue the Burlington from the control of certain contractor-directors, whom his biographer, Mr. Pearson, describes as "persons of integrity, who had conceived that in their twofold capacity as contractors and directors they were fully able to deal with themselves justly." Mr. Forbes thought otherwise. The stockholders, whom he had aroused, sided with him and he won.
   </p>
   <p>
   Mr. Forbes was the pioneer among Boston railroad-builders. His example and his success inspired many others, for Boston was not lacking then in men who were builders, though some lacked his wisdom, and some his character. Her enterprise and capital constructed, in large part, the Union Pacific, the Atchison, the Mexican Central, the Wisconsin Central, and 24 other railroads in the West and South. One by one these western and southern railroads passed out of Boston control; the greater part of them into the control of the Morgan allies. Before the Burlington was surrendered, Boston had begun to lose her dominion, even, over the railroads of New England. In 1900 the Boston & Albany was leased to the New York Central,—a Morgan property; and a few years later, another Morgan railroad—the New Haven—acquired control of nearly every other transportation line in New England. Now nothing is left of Boston's railroad dominion in the West and South, except the Eastern Kentucky Railroad—a line 36 miles long; and her control of the railroads of Massachusetts is limited to the Grafton & Upton with 19 miles of line and the Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn,—a passenger road 13 miles long.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The New Haven Monopoly
   </h2>
   <p>
   The rise of the New Haven Monopoly presents another striking example of combination as a developer of financial concentration; and it illustrates also the use to which "large security issues" are put.
   </p>
   <p>
   In 1892, when Mr. Morgan entered the New Haven directorate, it was a very prosperous little railroad with capital liabilities of $25,000,000 paying 10 per cent. dividends, and operating 508 miles of line. By 1899 the capitalization had grown to $80,477,600, but the aggregate mileage had also grown (mainly through merger or leases of other lines) to 2017. Fourteen years later, in 1913, when Mr. Morgan died and Mr. Mellen resigned, the mileage was 1997, just 20 miles less than in 1899; but the capital liabilities had increased to $425,935,000. Of course the business of the railroad had grown largely in those fourteen years; the road-bed was improved, bridges built, additional tracks added, and much equipment purchased; and for all this, new capital was needed; and additional issues were needed, also, because the company paid out in dividends more than it earned. But of the capital increase, over $200,000,000 was expended in the acquisition of the stock or other securities of some 121 other railroads, steamships, street railway-, electric-light-, gas- and water-companies. It was these outside properties, which made necessary the much discussed $67,000,000, 6 per cent. bond issue, as well as other large and expensive security issues. For in these fourteen years the improvements on the railroad including new equipment have cost, on the average, only $10,000,000 a year.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The New Haven Bankers
   </h2>
   <p>
   Few, if any, of those 121 companies which the New Haven acquired had, prior to their absorption by it, been financed by J. P. Morgan & Co. The needs of the Boston & Maine and Maine Central—the largest group—had, for generations, been met mainly through their own stockholders or through Boston banking houses. No investment banker had been a member of the Board of Directors of either of those companies. The New York, Ontario & Western—the next largest of the acquired railroads—had been financed in New York, but by persons apparently entirely independent of the Morgan allies. The smaller Connecticut railroads, now combined in the Central New England, had been financed mainly in Connecticut, or by independent New York bankers. The financing of the street railway companies had been done largely by individual financiers, or by small and independent bankers in the states or cities where the companies operate. Some of the steamship companies had been financed by their owners, some through independent bankers. As the result of the absorption of these 121 companies into the New Haven system, the financing of all these railroads, steamship companies, street railways, and other corporations, was made tributary to J. P. Morgan & Co.; and the independent bankers were eliminated or became satellites.And this financial concentration was proceeded with, although practically every one of these 121 companies was acquired by the New Haven in violation either of the state or federal law, or of both. Enforcement of the Sherman Act will doubtless result in dissolving this unwieldy illegal combination.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Coal Monopoly
   </h2>
   <p>
   Proof of the "cooperation" of the anthracite railroads is furnished by the ubiquitous presence of George F. Baker on the Board of Directors of the Reading, the Jersey Central, the Lackawanna, the Lehigh, the Erie, and the New York, Susquehanna & Western railroads, which together control nearly all the unmined anthracite as well as the actual tonnage. These roads have been an important factor in the development of the Money Trust. They are charged by the Department of Justice with fundamental violations both of the Sherman Law and of the Commodity clause of the Hepburn Act, which prohibits a railroad from carrying, in interstate trade, any commodity in which it has an interest, direct or indirect. Nearly every large issue of securities made in the last 14 years by any of these railroads (except the Erie), has been in connection with some act of combination. The combination of the anthracite railroads to suppress the construction, through the Temple Iron Company, of a competing coal road, has already been declared illegal by the Supreme Court of the United States. And in the bituminous coal field—the Kanawha District—the United States Circuit Court of Appeals has recently decreed that a similar combination by the Lake Shore, the Chesapeake & Ohio, and the Hocking Valley, be dissolved.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Other Railroad Companies
   </h2>
   <p>
   The cases of the Union Pacific and of the New Haven are typical—not exceptional. Our railroad history presents numerous instances of large security issues made wholly or mainly to effect combinations. Some of these combinations have been proper as a means of securing natural feeders or extensions of main lines. But far more of them have been dictated by the desire to suppress active or potential competition; or by personal ambition or greed; or by the mistaken belief that efficiency grows with size.
   </p>
   <p>
   Thus the monstrous combination of the Rock Island and the St. Louis and San Francisco with over 14,000 miles of line is recognized now to have been obviously inefficient. It was severed voluntarily; but, had it not been, must have crumbled soon from inherent defects, if not as a result of proceedings under the Sherman law. Both systems are suffering now from the effects of this unwise combination; the Frisco, itself greatly overcombined, has paid the penalty in receivership. The Rock Island—a name once expressive of railroad efficiency and stability—has, through its excessive recapitalizations and combinations, become a football of speculators, and a source of great apprehension to confiding investors. The combination of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton, and the Père Marquette led to several receiverships.
   </p>
   <p>
   There are, of course, other combinations which have not been disastrous to the owners of the railroads. But the fact that a railroad combination has not been disastrous does not necessarily justify it. The evil of the concentration of power is obvious; and as combination necessarily involves such concentration of power, the burden of justifying a combination should be placed upon those who seek to effect it.
   </p>
   <p>
   For instance, what public good has been subserved by allowing the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company to issue $50,000,000 of securities to acquire control of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad—a widely extended, self-sufficient system of 5,000 miles, which, under the wise management of President Milton H. Smith had prospered continuously for many years before the acquisition; and which has gross earnings nearly twice as large as those of the Atlantic Coast Line. The legality of this combination has been recently challenged by Senator Lea; and an investigation by the Interstate Commerce Commission has been ordered.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Pennsylvania
   </h2>
   <p>
   The reports from the Pennsylvania suggest the inquiry whether even this generally well-managed railroad is not suffering from excessive bigness. After 1898 it, too, bought, in large amounts, stocks in other railroads, including the Chesapeake & Ohio, the Baltimore & Ohio, and the Norfolk & Western. In 1906 it sold all its Chesapeake & Ohio stock, and a majority of its Baltimore & Ohio and Norfolk & Western holdings. Later it reversed its policy and resumed stock purchases, acquiring, among others, more Norfolk & Western and New York, New Haven & Hartford; and on Dec. 31, 1912, held securities valued at $331,909,154.32; of which, however, a large part represents Pennsylvania System securities. These securities (mostly stocks) constitute about one-third of the total assets of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The income on these securities in 1912 averaged only 4.30 per cent. on their valuation, while the Pennsylvania paid 6 per cent. on its stock. But the cost of carrying these foreign stocks is not limited to the difference between this income and outgo. To raise money on these stocks the Pennsylvania had to issue its own securities; and there is such a thing as an over-supply even of Pennsylvania securities. Over-supply of any stock depresses market values, and increases the cost to the Pennsylvania of raising new money. Recently came the welcome announcement of the management that it will dispose of its stocks in the anthracite coal mines; and it is intimated that it will divest itself also of other holdings in companies (like the Cambria Steel Company) extraneous to the business of railroading. This policy should be extended to include the disposition also of all stock in other railroads (like the Norfolk & Western, the Southern Pacific and the New Haven) which are not a part of the Pennsylvania System.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Recommendations
   </h2>
   <p>
   Six years ago the Interstate Commerce Commission, after investigating the Union Pacific transaction above referred to, recommended legislation to remedy the evils there disclosed. Upon concluding recently its investigation of the New Haven, the Commission repeated and amplified those recommendations, saying:
   </p>
   <p>
   "No student of the railroad problem can doubt that a most prolific source of financial disaster and complication to railroads in the past has been the desire and ability of railroad managers to engage in enterprises outside the legitimate operation of their railroads, especially by the acquisition of other railroads and their securities. The evil which results, first, to the investing public, and, finally, to the general public, cannot be corrected after the transaction has taken place; it can be easily and effectively prohibited. In our opinion the following propositions lie at the foundation of all adequate regulation of interstate railroads:
   </p>
   <p>
   1. Every interstate railroad should be prohibited from spending money or incurring liability or acquiring property not in the operation of its railroad or in the legitimate improvement, extension, or development of that railroad.
   </p>
   <p>
   2. No interstate railroad should be permitted to lease or purchase any other railroad, nor to acquire the stocks or securities of any other railroad, nor to guarantee the same, directl[y] or indirectly, without the approval of the federal government.
   </p>
   <p>
   3. No stocks or bonds should be issued by an interstate railroad except for the purposes sanctioned in the two preceding paragraphs, and none should be issued without the approval of the federal government.
   </p>
   <p>
   It may be unwise to attempt to specify the price at which and the manner in which railroad stocks and securities shall be disposed of; but it is easy and safe to define the purpose for which they may be issued and to confine the expenditure of the money realized to that purpose.”
   </p>
   <p>
   These recommendations are in substantial accord with those adopted by the National Association of Railway Commissioners. They should be enacted into law. And they should be supplemented by amendments of the Commodity Clause of the Hepburn Act, so that:
   </p>
   <p>
   1. Railroads will be effectually prohibited from owning stock in corporations whose products they transport;
   </p>
   <p>
   2. Such corporations will be prohibited from owning important stockholdings in railroads; and
   </p>
   <p>
   3. Holding companies will be prohibited from controlling, as does the Reading, both a railroad and corporations whose commodities it transports.
   </p>
   <p>
   If laws such as these are enacted and duly enforced, we shall be protected from a recurrence of tragedies like the New Haven, of domestic scandals like the Chicago and Alton, and of international ones like the Frisco. We shall also escape from that inefficiency which is attendant upon excessive size. But what is far more important, we shall, by such legislation, remove a potent factor in financial concentration. Decentralization will begin. The liberated smaller units will find no difficulty in financing their needs without bowing the knee to money lords. And a long step will have been taken toward attainment of the New Freedom.
   </p>
   <h1>
   Chapter IX: The Failure of Banker-Management
   </h1>
   <p>
   Thereis not one moral, but many, to be drawn from the Decline of the New Haven and the Fall of Mellen. That history offers texts for many sermons. It illustrates the Evils of Monopoly, the Curse of Bigness, the Futility of Lying, and the Pitfalls of Law-Breaking. But perhaps the most impressive lesson that it should teach to investors is the failure of banker-management.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Banker Control
   </h2>
   <p>
   For years J. P. Morgan & Co. were the fiscal agents of the New Haven. For years Mr. Morgan wasthedirector of the Company. He gave to that property probably closer personal attention than to any other of his many interests. Stockholders' meetings are rarely interesting or important; and few indeed must have been the occasions when Mr. Morgan attended any stockholders' meeting of other companies in which he was a director. But it was his habit, when in America, to be present at meetings of the New Haven. In 1907, when the policy of monopolistic expansion was first challenged, and again at the meeting in 1909 (after Massachusetts had unwisely accorded its sanction to the Boston & Maine merger), Mr. Morgan himself moved the large increases of stock which were unanimously voted. Of course, he attended the important directors' meeting. His will was law. President Mellen indicated this in his statement before Interstate Commerce Commissioner Prouty, while discussing the New York, Westchester & Boston—the railroad without a terminal in New York, which cost the New Haven $1,500,000 a mile to acquire, and was then costing it, in operating deficits and interest charges, $100,000 a month to run:
   </p>
   <p>
   "I am in a very embarrassing position, Mr. Commissioner, regarding the New York, Westchester & Boston. I have never been enthusiastic or at all optimistic of its being a good investment for our company in the present, or in the immediate future; but people in whom I had greater confidence than I have in myself thought it was wise and desirable; I yielded my judgment; indeed, I don't know that it would have made much difference whether I yielded or not.”

   The Banker's Responsibility
   </h2>
   <p>
   Bankers are credited with being a conservative force in the community. The tradition lingers that they are preeminently "safe and sane." And yet, the most grievous fault of this banker-managed railroad has been its financial recklessness—a fault that has already brought heavy losses to many thousands of small investors throughout New England for whom bankers are supposed to be natural guardians. In a community where its railroad stocks have for generations been deemed absolutely safe investments, the passing of the New Haven and of the Boston & Maine dividends after an unbroken dividend record of generations comes as a disaster.
   </p>
   <p>
   This disaster is due mainly to enterprises outside the legitimate operation of these railroads; for no railroad company has equaled the New Haven in the quantity and extravagance of its outside enterprises. But it must be remembered, that neither the president of the New Haven nor any other railroad manager could engage in such transactions without the sanction of the Board of Directors. It is the directors, not Mr. Mellen, who should bear the responsibility.
   </p>
   <p>
   Close scrutiny of the transactions discloses no justification. On the contrary, scrutiny serves only to make more clear the gravity of the errors committed. Not merely were recklessly extravagant acquisitions made in mad pursuit of monopoly; but the financial judgment, the financiering itself, was conspicuously bad. To pay for property several times what it is worth, to engage in grossly unwise enterprises, are errors of which no conservative directors should be found guilty; for perhaps the most important function of directors is to test the conclusions and curb by calm counsel the excessive zeal of too ambitious managers. But while we have no right to expect from bankers exceptionally good judgment in ordinary business matters; we do have a right to expect from them prudence, reasonably good financiering, and insistence upon straightforward accounting. And it is just the lack of these qualities in the New Haven management to which the severe criticism of the Interstate Commerce Commission is particularly directed.
   </p>
   <p>
   Commissioner Prouty calls attention to the vast increase of capitalization. During the nine years beginning July 1, 1903, the capital of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company itself increased from $93,000,000 to about $417,000,000 (excluding premiums). That fact alone would not convict the management of reckless financiering ; but the fact that so little of the new capital was represented by stock might well raise a question as to its conservativeness. For the indebtedness (including guaranties) was increased over twenty times (from about $14,000,000 to $300,000,000), while the stock outstanding in the hands of the public was not doubled ($80,000,000 to $158,000,000). Still, in these days of large things, even such growth of corporate liabilities might be consistent with "safe and sane management.”
   </p>
   <p>
   But what can be said in defense of the financial judgment of the banker-management under which these two railroads find themselves confronted, in the fateful year 1913, with a most disquieting floating indebtedness? On March 31, the New Haven had outstanding $43,000,000 in short-time notes; the Boston & Maine had then outstanding $24,500,000, which have been increased since to $27,000,000; and additional notes have been issued by several of its subsidiary lines. Mainly to meet its share of these loans, the New Haven, which before its great expansion could sell at par 3 1/2 per cent. bonds convertible into stock at $150 a share, was so eager to issue at par $67,500,000 of its 6 per cent. 20-year bonds convertible into stock as to agree to pay J. P. Morgan & Co. a 2 1/2 per cent. underwriting commission. True, money was "tight" then. But is it not very bad financiering to be so unprepared for the "tight" money market which had been long expected? Indeed, the New Haven's management, particularly, ought to have avoided such an error; for it committed a similar one in the "tight" money market of 1907-1908, when it had to sell at par $39,000,000 of its 6 per cent. 40-year bonds.
   </p>
   <p>
   These huge short-time borrowings of the System were not due to unexpected emergencies or to their monetary conditions. They were of gradual growth. On June 30, 1910, the two companies owed in short-term notes only $10,180,364; by June 30, 1911, the amount had grown to $30,759,959; by June 30, 1912, to $45,395,000; and in 1913 to over $70,000,000. Of course the rate of interest on the loans increased also very largely. And these loans were incurred unnecessarily. They represent, in the main, not improvements on the New Haven or on the Boston & Maine Railroads, but money borrowed either to pay for stocks in other companies which these companies could not afford to buy, or to pay dividends which had not been earned.
   </p>
   <p>
   In five years out of the last six the New Haven Railroad has, on its own showing, paid dividends in excess of the year's earnings; and the annual deficits disclosed would have been much larger if proper charges for depreciation of equipment and of steamships had been made. In each of the last three years, during which the New Haven had absolute control of the Boston & Maine, the latter paid out in dividends so much in excess of earnings that before April, 1913, the surplus accumulated in earlier years had been converted into a deficit.
   </p>
   <p>
   Surely these facts show, at least, an extraordinary lack of financial prudence.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Why Banker-Management Failed
   </h2>
   <p>
   Now, how can the failure of the banker-management of the New Haven be explained?
   </p>
   <p>
   A few have questioned the ability; a few the integrity of the bankers. Commissioner Prouty attributed the mistakes made to the Company's pursuit of a transportation monopoly.
   </p>
   <p>
   "The reason," says he, "is as apparent as the fact itself. The present management of that Company started out with the purpose of controlling the transportation facilities of New England. In the accomplishment of that purpose it bought what must be had and paid what must be paid. To this purpose and its attempted execution can be traced every one of these financial misfortunes and derelictions.”
   </p>
   <p>
   But it still remains to find the cause of the bad judgment exercised by the eminent banker-management in entering upon and in carrying out the policy of monopoly. For there were as grave errors in the execution of the policy of monopoly as in its adoption. Indeed, it was the aggregation of important errors of detail which compelled first the reduction, then the passing of dividends and which ultimately impaired the Company's credit.
   </p>
   <p>
   The failure of the banker-management of the New Haven cannot be explained as the shortcomings of individuals. The failure was not accidental. It was not exceptional. It was the natural result of confusing the functions of banker and business man.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Undivided Loyalty
   </h2>
   <p>
   The banker should be detached from the business for which he performs the banking service. This detachment is desirable, in the first place, in order to avoid conflict of interest. The relation of banker-directors to corporations which they finance has been a subject of just criticism. Their conflicting interests necessarily prevent single-minded devotion to the corporation. When a banker-director of a railroad decides as railroad man that it shall issue securities, and then sells them to himself as banker, fixing the price at which they are to be taken, there is necessarily grave danger that the interests of the railroad may suffer—suffer both through issuing of securities which ought not to be issued, and from selling them at a price less favorable to the company than should have been obtained. For it is ordinarily impossible for a banker-director to judge impartially between the corporation and himself. Even if he succeeded in being impartial, the relation would not conduce to the best interests of the company. The best bargains are made when buyer and seller are represented by different persons.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Detachment an Essential
   </h2>
   <p>
   But the objection to banker-management does not rest wholly, or perhaps mainly, upon the importance of avoiding divided loyalty. A complete detachment of the banker from the corporation is necessary in order to secure for the railroad the benefit of the clearest financial judgment; for the banker's judgment will be necessarily clouded by participation in the management or by ultimate responsibility for the policy actually pursued. It is outside financial advice which the railroad needs.
   </p>
   <p>
   Long ago it was recognized that "a man who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client." The essential reason for this is that soundness of judgment is easily obscured by self-interest. Similarly, it is not the proper function of the banker to construct, purchase, or operate railroads, or to engage in industrial enterprises. The proper function of the banker is to give to or to withhold credit from other concerns; to purchase or to refuse to purchase securities from other concerns; and to sell securities to other customers. The proper exercise of this function demands that the banker should be wholly detached from the concern whose credit or securities are under consideration. His decision to grant or to withhold credit, to purchase or not to purchase securities, involves passing judgment on the efficiency of the management or the soundness of the enterprise; and he ought not to occupy a position where in so doing he is passing judgment on himself. Of course detachment does not imply lack of knowledge. The banker should act only with full knowledge, just as a lawyer should act only with full knowledge. The banker who undertakes to make loans to or purchase securities from a railroad for sale to his other customers ought to have as full knowledge of its affairs as does its legal adviser. But the banker should not be, in any sense, his own client. He should not, in the capacity of banker, pass judgment upon the wisdom of his own plans or acts as railroad man.
   </p>
   <p>
   Such a detached attitude on the part of the banker is demanded also in the interest of his other customers—the purchasers of corporate securities. The investment banker stands toward a large part of his customers in a position of trust, which should be fully recognized. The small investors, particularly the women, who are holding an ever-increasing proportion of our corporate securities, commonly buy on the recommendation of their bankers. The small investors do not, and in most cases cannot, ascertain for themselves the facts on which to base a proper judgment as to the soundness of securities offered. And even if these investors were furnished with the facts, they lack the business experience essential to forming a proper judgment. Such investors need and are entitled to have the bankers' advice, and obviously their unbiased advice; and the advice cannot be unbiased where the banker, as part of the corporation's management, has participated in the creation of the securities which are the subject of sale to the investor.
   </p>
   <p>
   Is it conceivable that the great house of Morgan would have aided in providing the New Haven with the hundreds of millions so unwisely expended, if its judgment had not been clouded by participation in the New Haven's management?
   </p>

   Chapter X: The Inefficiency of the Oligarchs
   </h1>
   <p>
   We must break the Money Trust or the Money Trust will break us.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Interstate Commerce Commission said in its report on the most disastrous of the recent wrecks on the New Haven Railroad:
   </p>
   <p>
   "On this directorate were and are men whom the confiding public recognize as magicians in the art of finance, and wizards in the construction, operation, and consolidation of great systems of railroads. The public therefore rested secure that with the knowledge of the railroad art possessed by such men investments and travel should both be safe. Experience has shown that this reliance of the public was not justified as to either finance or safety.”
   </p>
   <p>
   This failure of banker-management is not surprising. The surprise is that men should have supposed it would succeed. For banker-management contravenes the fundamental laws of human limitations: First, that no man can serve two masters; second, that a man cannot at the same time do many things well.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Seeming Successes
   </h2>
   <p>
   There are numerous seeming exceptions to these rules; and a relatively few real ones. Of course, many banker-managed properties have been prosperous; some for a long time, at the expense of the public; some for a shorter time, because of the impetus attained before they were banker-managed. It is not difficult to have a large net income, where one has the field to oneself, has all the advantage privilege can give, and may "charge all the traffic will bear." And even in competitive business the success of a long-established, well-organized business with a widely extended good-will, must continue for a considerable time; especially if buttressed by intertwined relations constantly giving it the preference over competitors. The real test of efficiency comes when success has to be struggled for; when natural or legal conditions limit the charges which may be made for the goods sold or service rendered. Our banker-managed railroads have recently been subjected to such a test, and they have failed to pass it. "It is only,"' says Goethe, "when working within limitations, that the master is disclosed.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   Why Oligarchy Fails
   </h2>
   <p>
   Banker-management fails, partly because the private interest destroys soundness of judgment and undermines loyalty. It fails partly, also, because banker directors are led by their occupation (and often even by the mere fact of their location remote from the operated properties) to apply a false test in making their decisions. Prominent in the banker-director mind is always this thought: "What will be the probable effect of our action upon the market value of the company's stock and bonds, or, indeed, generally upon stock exchange values?" The stock market is so much a part of the investment-banker's life, that he cannot help being affected by this consideration, however disinterested he may be. The stock market is sensitive. Facts are often misinterpreted "by the street'" or by investors. And with the best of intentions, directors susceptible to such influences are led to unwise decisions in the effort to prevent misinterpretations. Thus, expenditures necessary for maintenance, or for the ultimate good of a property are often deferred by banker-directors, because of the belief that the making of themnow, would (by showing smaller net earnings), create a bad, and even false, impression on the market. Dividends are paid which should not be, because of the effect which it is believed reduction or suspension would have upon the market value of the company's securities. To exercise a sound judgment in the difficult affairs of business is, at best, a delicate operation. And no man can successfully perform that function whose mind is diverted, however innocently, from the study of, "what is best in the long run for the company of which I am director?" The banker-director is peculiarly liable to such distortion of judgment by reason of his occupation and his environment. But there is a further reason why, ordinarily, banker-management must fail.
   </p>
   <h2>
   The Element of Time
   </h2>
   <p>
   The banker, with his multiplicity of interests, cannot ordinarily give the time essential to proper supervision and to acquiring that knowledge of the facts necessary to the exercise of sound judgment. The Century Dictionary tells us that a Director is "one who directs; one who guides, superintends, governs and manages." Real efficiency in any business in which conditions are ever changing must ultimately depend, in large measure, upon the correctness of the judgment exercised, almost from day to day, on the important problems as they arise. And how can the leading bankers, necessarily engrossed in the problems of their own vast private business, get time to know and to correlate the facts concerning so many other complex businesses? Besides, they start usually with ignorance of the particular business which they are supposed to direct. When the last paper was signed which created the Steel Trust, one of the lawyers (as Mr. Perkins frankly tells us) said: "That signature is the last one necessary to put the Steel industry, on a large scale, into the hands of men who do not know anything about it.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   Avocations of the Oligarchs
   </h2>
   <p>
   The New Haven System is not a railroad, but an agglomeration of a railroad plus 121 separate corporations, control of which was acquired by the New Haven after that railroad attained its full growth of about 2,000 miles of line. In administering the railroad and each of the properties formerly managed through these 122 separate companies, there must arise from time to time difficult questions on which the directors should pass judgment. The real managing directors of the New Haven system during the decade of its decline were: J. Pierpont Morgan, George F. Baker, and William Rockefeller. Mr. Morgan was, until his death in 1913, the head of perhaps the largest banking house in the world. Mr. Baker was, until 1909, President and then Chairman of the Board of Directors of one of America's leading banks (the First National of New York), and Mr. Rockefeller was, until 1911, President of the Standard Oil Company. Each was well advanced in years. Yet each of these men, besides the duties of his own vast business, and important private interests, undertook to "guide, superintend, govern and manage," not only the New Haven but also the following other corporations, some of which were similarly complex: Mr. Morgan, 48 corporations, including 40 railroad corporations, with at least 100 subsidiary companies, and 16,000 miles of line; 3 banks and trust or insurance companies; 5 industrial and public service companies. Mr. Baker, 48 corporations, including 15 railroad corporations, with at least 158 subsidiaries; and 37,400 miles of track; 18 banks, and trust or insurance companies; 15 public-service corporations and industrial concerns. Mr. Rockefeller, 37 corporations, including 23 railroad corporations with at least 117 subsidiary companies, and 26,400 miles of line; 5 banks, trust or insurance companies; 9 public service companies and industrial concerns.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Substitutes
   </h2>
   <p>
   It has been urged that in view of the heavy burdens which the leaders of finance assume in directing Business-America, we should be patient of error and refrain from criticism, lest the leaders be deterred from continuing to perform this public service. A very respectable Boston daily said a few days after Commissioner McCord's report on the North Haven wreck:
   </p>
   <p>
   "It is believed that the New Haven pillory repeated with some frequency will make the part of railroad director quite undesirable and hard to fill, and more and more avoided by responsible men. Indeed it may even become so that men will have to be paid a substantial salary to compensate them in some degree for the risk involved in being on the board of directors.”
   </p>
   <p>
   But there is no occasion for alarm. The American people have as little need of oligarchy in business as in politics. There are thousands of men in America who could have performed for the New Haven stockholders the task of one "who guides, superintends, governs and manages," better than did Mr. Morgan, Mr. Baker and Mr. Rockefeller. For though possessing less native ability, even the average business man would have done better than they, because working under proper conditions. There is great strength in serving with singleness of purpose one master only. There is great strength in having time to give to a business the attention which its difficult problems demand. And tens of thousands more Americans could be rendered competent to guide our important businesses. Liberty is the greatest developer. Herodotus tells us that while the tyrants ruled, the Athenians were no better fighters than their neighbors; but when freed, they immediately surpassed all others. If industrial democracy—true coöperation—should be substituted for industrial absolutism, there would be no lack of industrial leaders.
   </p>
   <h2>
   England's Big Business
   </h2>
   <p>
   England, too, has big business. But her big business is the Cooperative Wholesale Society, with a wonderful story of 50 years of beneficent growth. Its annual turnover is now about $150,000,000—an amount exceeded by the sales of only a few American industrials; an amount larger than the gross receipts of any American railroad, except the Pennsylvania and the New York Central systems. Its business is very diversified, for its purpose is to supply the needs of its members. It includes that of wholesale dealer, of manufacturer, of grower, of miner, of banker, of insurer and of carrier. It operates the biggest flour mills and the biggest shoe factory in all Great Britain. It manufactures woolen cloths, all kinds of men's, women's and children's clothing, a dozen kinds of prepared foods, and as many household articles. It operates creameries. It carries on every branch of the printing business. It is now buying coal lands. It has a bacon factory in Denmark, and a tallow and oil factory in Australia. It grows tea in Ceylon. And through all the purchasing done by the Society runs this general principle: Go direct to the source of production, whether at home or abroad, so as to save commissions of middlemen and agents. Accordingly, it has buyers and warehouses in the United States, Canada, Australia, Spain, Denmark and Sweden. It owns steamers plying between Continental and English ports. It has an important banking department; it insures the property and person of its members. Every one of these departments is conducted in competition with the most efficient concerns in their respective lines in Great Britain. The Cooperative Wholesale Society makes its purchases, and manufactures its products, in order to supply the 1399 local distributive, cooperative societies scattered over all England; but each local society is at liberty to buy from the wholesale society, or not, as it chooses; and they buy only if the Cooperative Wholesale sells at market prices. This the Cooperative actually does; and it is able besides to return to the local a fair dividend on its purchases.
   </p>
   <h2>
   Industrial Democracy
   </h2>
   <p>
   Now, how are the directors of this great business chosen? Not by England's leading bankers, or other notabilities, supposed to possess unusual wisdom; but democratically, by all of the people interested in the operations of the Society. And the number of such persons who have directly or indirectly a voice in the selection of the directors of the English Cooperative Wholesale Society is 2,750,000. For the directors of the Wholesale Society are elected by vote of the delegates of the 1399 retail societies. And the delegates of the retail societies are, in turn, selected by the members of the local societies;—that is, by the consumers, on the principle of one man, one vote, regardless of the amount of capital contributed. Note what kind of men these industrial democrats select to exercise executive control of their vast organization. Not all-wise bankers or their dummies, but men who have risen from the ranks of cooperation; men who, by conspicuous service in the local societies have won the respect and confidence of their fellows. The directors are elected for one year only; but a director is rarely un-seated. J. T. W. Mitchell was president of the Society continuously for 21 years. Thirty-two directors are selected in this manner. Each gives to the business of the Society his whole time and attention; and the aggregate salaries of the thirty-two is less than that of many a single executive in American corporations; for these directors of England's big business serve each for a salary of about $1500 a year.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Cooperative Wholesale Society of England is the oldest and largest of these institutions. But similar wholesale societies exist in 15 other countries. The Scotch Society (which William Maxwell has served most efficiently as President for thirty years at a salary never exceeding $38 a week) has a turn-over of more than $50,000,000 a year.
   </p>
   <h2>
   A Remedy for Trusts
   </h2>
   <p>
   Albert Sonnichsen, General Secretary of the Cooperative League, tells in theAmerican Review of Reviewsfor April, 1913, how the Swedish Wholesale Society curbed the Sugar Trust; how it crushed the Margerine Combine (compelling it to dissolve after having lost 2,300,000 crowns in the struggle); and how in Switzerland the Wholesale Society forced the dissolution of the Shoe Manufacturers Association. He tells also this memorable incident:
   </p>
   <p>
   "Six years ago, at an international congress in Cremona, Dr. Hans Müller, a Swiss delegate, presented a resolution by which an international wholesale society should be created. Luigi Luzzatti, Italian Minister of State and an ardent member of the movement, was in the chair. Those who were present say Luzzatti paused, his eyes lighted up, then, dramatically raising his hand, he said: ‘Dr. Muller proposes to the assembly a great idea—that of opposing to the great trusts, the Rockefellers of the world, a world-wide cooperative alliance which shall become so powerful as to crush the trusts.’ “
   </p>
   <h2>
   Cooperation in America
   </h2>
   <p>
   America has no Wholesale Cooperative Society able to grapple with the trusts. But it has some very strong retail societies, like the Tamarack of Michigan, which has distributed in dividends to its members $1,144,000 in 23 years. The recent high cost of living has greatly stimulated interest in the cooperative movement; and John Graham Brooks reports that we have already about 350 local distributive societies. The movement toward federation is progressing. There are over 100 cooperative stores in Minnesota, Wisconsin and other Northwestern states, many of which were organized by or through the zealous work of Mr. Tousley and his associates of the Right Relationship League and are in some ways affiliated. In New York City 83 organizations are affiliated with the Cooperative League. In New Jersey the societies have federated into the American Cooperative Alliance of Northern New Jersey. In California, long the seat of effective cooperative work, a central management committee is developing. And progressive Wisconsin has recently legislated wisely to develop cooperation throughout the state.
   </p>
   <p>
   Among our farmers the interest in cooperation is especially keen. The federal government has just established a separate bureau of the Department of Agriculture to aid in the study, development and introduction of the best methods of cooperation in the working of farms, in buying, and in distribution; and special attention is now being given to farm credits—a field of cooperation in which Continental Europe has achieved complete success, and to which David Lubin, America's delegate to the International Institute of Agriculture at Rome, has, among others, done much to direct our attention.

   <h2>
   People's Savings Banks
   </h2>
   <p>
   The German farmer has achieved democratic banking. The 13,000 little cooperative credit associations, with an average membership of about 90 persons, are truly banks of the people, by the people and for the people.
   </p>
   <p>
   First: The banks' resources areofthe people. These aggregate about $500,000,000. Of this amount $375,000,000 represents the farmers' savings deposits; $50,000,000, the farmers' current deposits; $6,000,000, the farmers' share capital; and $13,000,000, amounts earned and placed in the reserve. Thus, nearly nine-tenths of these large resources belong to the farmers—that is, to the members of the banks.
   </p>
   <p>
   Second: The banks are managedbythe people—that is, the members. And membership is easily attained; for the average amount of paid-up share capital was, in 1909, less than $5 per member. Each member has one vote regardless of the number of his shares or the amount of his deposits. These members elect the officers. The committees and trustees (and often even, the treasurer) serve without pay: so that the expenses of the banks are, on the average, about $150 a year.
   </p>
   <p>
   Third: The banks areforthe people. The farmers' money is loaned by the farmer to the farmer at a low rate of interest (usually 4 per cent. to 6 per cent.); the shareholders receiving, on their shares, the same rate of interest that the borrowers pay on their loans. Thus the resources of all farmers are made available to each farmer, for productive purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
   This democratic rural banking is not confined to Germany. As Henry W. Wolff says in his book on cooperative banks:
   </p>
   <p>
   "Propagating themselves by their own merits, little people's cooperative banks have overspread Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Belgium. Russia is following up those countries; France is striving strenuously for the possession of cooperative credit. Servia, Roumania, and Bulgaria have made such credit their own. Canada has scored its first success on the road to its acquisition. Cyprus, and even Jamaica, have made their first start. Ireland has substantial first-fruits to show of her economic sowings.
   </p>
   <p>
   "South Africa is groping its way to the same goal. Egypt has discovered the necessity of cooperative banks, even by the side of Lord Cromer's pet creation, the richly endowed `agricultural bank.' India has made a beginning full of promise. And even in far Japan, and in China, people are trying to acclimatize the more perfected organizations of Schulze-Delitzsch and Raffeisen. The entire world seems girdled with a ring of cooperative credit. Only the United States and Great Britain still lag lamentably behind.”
   </p>
   <h2>
   Bankers' Savings Banks
   </h2>
   <p>
   The savings banks of America present a striking contrast to these democratic banks. Our savings banks also have performed a great service. They have provided for the people's funds safe depositories with some income return. Thereby they have encouraged thrift and have created, among other things, reserves for the proverbial "rainy day." They have also discouraged "old stocking" hoarding, which diverts the money of the country from the channels of trade. American savings banks are also, in a sense, banksofthe people; for it is the people's money which is administered by them. The $4,500,000,000 deposits in 2,000 American savings banks belong to about ten million people, who have an average deposit of about $450. But our savings banks are not banksbythe people, nor, in the full sense,forthe people.
   </p>
   <p>
   First: American savings banks are not managedbythe people. The stock-savings banks, most prevalent in the Middle West and the South, are purely commercial enterprises, managed, of course, by the stockholders’ representatives. The mutual savings banks, most prevalent in the Eastern states, have no stockholders; but the depositors have no voice in the management. The banks are managed by trusteesforthe people, practically a self-constituted and self-perpetuating body, composed of "leading" and, to a large extent, public-spirited citizens. Among them (at least in the larger cities) there is apt to be a predominance of investment bankers, and bank directors. Thus the three largest savings banks of Boston (whose aggregate deposits exceed those of the other 18 banks) have together 81 trustees. Of these, 52 are investment bankers or directors in other Massachusetts banks or trust companies.
   </p>

   Second: The funds of our savings banks (whether stock or purely mutual) are not used mainlyforthe people. The depositors are allowed interest (usually from 3 to 4 per cent.). In the mutual savings banks they receive ultimately all the net earnings. But the money gathered in these reservoirs is not used to aid productively persons of the classes who make the deposits. The depositors are largely wage earners, salaried people, or members of small tradesmen's families. Statically the money is used for them. Dynamically it is used for the capitalist. For rare, indeed, are the instances when savings banks' moneys are loaned to advance productively one of the depositor class. Such persons would seldom be able to provide the required security; and it is doubtful whether their small needs would, in any event, receive consideration. In 1912 the largest of Boston's mutual savings banks—the Provident Institution for Savings, which is the pioneer mutual savings bank of America—managed $53,000,000 of people’s money. Nearly one-half of the resources ($24,262,072) was invested in bonds—state, municipal, railroad, railway and telephone and in bank stock; or was deposited in national banks or trust companies. Two-fifths of the resources ($20,764,770) were loaned on real estate mortgages; and the average amount of a loan was $52,569. One-seventh of the resources ($7,566,612) was loaned on personal security; and the average of each of these loans was $54,830. Obviously, the "small man" is not conspicuous among the borrowers; and these large-scale investments do not even serve the individual depositor especially well; for this bank pays its depositors a rate of interest lower than the average. Even our admirable Postal Savings Bank system serves productively mainly the capitalist. These postal saving stations are in effect catch-basins merely, which collect the people's money for distribution among the national banks.

   Alphonse Desjardins of Levis, Province of Quebec, has demonstrated that cooperative credit associations are applicable, also, to at least some urban communities. Levis, situated on the St. Lawrence opposite the City of Quebec, is a city of 8,000 inhabitants. Desjardins himself is a man of the people. Many years ago he became impressed with the fact that the people's savings were not utilized primarily to aid the people productively. There were then located in Levis branches of three ordinary banks of deposit—a mutual savings bank, the postal savings bank, and three incorporated "loaners"; but the people were not served. After much thinking, he chanced to read of the European rural banks. He proceeded to work out the idea for use in Levis; and in 1900 established there the first "credit-union." For seven years he watched carefully the operations of this little bank. The pioneer union had accumulated in that period $80,000 in resources. It had made 2,900 loans to its members, aggregating $350,000; the loans averaging $120 in amount, and the interest rate 6 1/2 per cent. In all this time the bank hadnot met with a single loss. Then Desjardins concluded that democratic banking was applicable to Canada; and he proceeded to establish other credit-unions. In the last 5 years the number of credit-unions in the Province of Quebec has grown to 121; and 19 have been established in the Province of Ontario. Desjardins was not merely the pioneer. All the later credit-unions also have been established through his aid; and 24 applications are now in hand requesting like assistance from him. Year after year that aid has been given without pay by this public-spirited man of large family and small means, who lives as simply as the ordinary mechanic. And it is noteworthy that this rapidly extending system of cooperative credit-banks has been established in Canada wholely without government aid, Desjardins having given his services free, and his travelling expenses having been paid by those seeking his assistance.
   </p>
   <p>
   In 1909, Massachusetts, under Desjardins' guidance, enacted a law for the incorporation of credit-unions. The first union established in Springfield, in 1910, was named after Herbert Myrick—a strong advocate of cooperative finance. Since then 25 other unions have been formed; and the names of the unions and of their officers disclose that 11 are Jewish, 8 French-Canadian, and 2 Italian—a strong indication that the immigrant is not unprepared for financial democracy. There is reason to believe that these people's banks will spread rapidly in the United States and that they will succeed. For the cooperative building and loan associations, managed by wage-earners and salary-earners, who joined together for systematic saving and ownership of houses—have prospered in many states. In Massachusetts, where they have existed for 35 years, their success has been notable—the number, in 1912, being 162, and their aggregate assets nearly $75,000,000.
   </p>
   <p>
   Thus farmers, workingmen, and clerks are learning to use their little capital and their savings to help one another instead of turning over their money to the great bankers for safe keeping, and to be themselves exploited. And may we not expect that when the cooperative movement develops in America, merchants and manufacturers will learn from farmers and workingmen how to help themselves by helping one another, and thus join in attaining the New Freedom for all? When merchants and manufacturers learn this lesson, money kings will lose subjects, and swollen fortunes may shrink; but industries will flourish, because the faculties of men will be liberated and developed.
   </p>
   <p>
   President Wilson has said wisely:
   </p>
   <p>
   "No country can afford to have its prosperity originated by a small controlling class. The treasury of America does not lie in the brains of the small body of men now in control of the great enterprises… It depends upon the inventions of unknown men, upon the originations of unknown men, upon the ambitions of unknown men. Every country is renewed out of the ranks of the unknown, not out of the ranks of the already famous and powerful in control.”
   </p>

   The End

   <p>
   OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY by Louis D. Brandeis
   </p>
   <p>
   In 1912, Woodrow Wilson campaigned for President using many Progressive ideas about strengthening the economy: banking reform, tariff reduction and the elimination of monopolies and trusts. The consolidation of these ideas became known as the New Freedom.
   </p>
   <p>
   After Wilson's election, Louis Brandeis (who was responsible for many of Wilson's ideas in the first place) wrote a series of articles for Harper's Weekly which outlined why the New Freedom was necessary and how best to implement it. In 1914, the articles were collected in book form and published under the title Other People's Money--and How the Bankers Use It.
   </p>
   <p>
   Brandeis' central thesis was that the large banking houses were colluding with businessmen to create trusts in America's major industries. Brandeis felt that not only did trusts stifle competition, but also they became so large that they became unable to operate efficiently.
   </p>
   <p>
   Brandeis backed up his arguments with facts--copious facts gleaned from his battles against J. P. Morgan and Charles Mellen in the New Haven Railroad merger battle and from the Pujo Committee--a House committee report that investigated the abuses of the "Money Trust.”
   </p>
   <p>
   Wilson was able to push through a number of laws regarding the regulation of business and trusts, but in many ways, due to mergers and stock manipulation, conditions in the business world today remain the same. Many of the details in Other People's Money may be dated, but its central ideas remain relevant--so much so that it is still in print almost 90 years after it was first published.

   <h1>
   前言
   </h1>
   <p>
   当路易斯-D-布兰代斯关于货币信托的系列文章在《哈珀周刊》（Harper's Weekly）上发表时，许多人询问如何以更容易理解的永久形式出版。然而，即使没有通过邮件的这种紧迫性，也可以看出这些文章不可避免地构成了一本书，因为它们体现了一个分析和叙述，而这个思想在我们这个时代的伟大工业运动中是美国最专业的。这些调查意味着细心的公众认识到这是对历史的贡献。这是有史以来对我们商业发展的那一部分发表的最清晰和最深刻的论述，正如威尔逊总统和其他智者所说，这一部分已经成为我们最大的问题。我们时代的故事是工业的故事。除非理解利用蒸汽和电力之后的扩张和集中，理解这种变化的巨大用途和巨大的过度，否则未来的任何学者都无法权威地描述我们的时代。在我看来，未来的历史学家不会在我们的当代文献中找到如此精湛的分析，说明为什么集中会误入歧途。我只是许多人中的一个，他们认为布兰代斯先生在经济学领域拥有我们这个时代最具创造性和健全的头脑。当他的文章在《哈珀周刊》上发表时，我有充分的机会了解到，在聪明人中间有多么广泛的信念，即对我们的货币信托的杰出诊断是多年来对当前思想最重要的贡献。
   </p>
   <p>
   『伟大』一词我不会随便使用，我把布兰代斯先生看成是一个『伟大』的人。在他的智力构成中，最重要的因素之一是他对数字的理解。正如该国一位主要金融家对我说的那样：『布兰代斯先生作为律师的伟大是他作为数学家的伟大的一部分』。我对这个问题的看法在《哈珀周刊》的以下社论中得到了充分的说明。
   </p>
   <p>
   算术
   </p>
   <p>
   在纽约大都会引力公司（Metropolitan Traction Company of New York ）落入接管人之手的大约五年前，布兰代斯先生从波士顿赶来，在库珀联盟的一次演讲中预言该公司一定会失败。纽约和波士顿的主要银行家都在向他们的客户衷心推荐该股票。布莱尼斯先生仅仅通过分析公布的数字就做出了他的预言。他是如何在平肖-格拉维斯-巴林格（Pinchot-Glavis-Ballinger）的争论中获胜的？毫无疑问，是以各种方式；但最关键的一步也许是他算出了一个快速工作者需要多长时间来翻阅格拉维斯-巴林格（Glavis-Ballinger）的记录并对其进行归纳整理；于是他认定威克萨姆（Wickersham）先生不可能在所说的那个时间做出报告，因此它一定是在之前做出的。
   </p>
   <p>
   布兰迪尔先生对当前历史的其他贡献大多涉及算术。当他成功地阻止了运费的提高时，是通过对成本的精确分析。当他让储蓄银行保险在马萨诸塞州开始时，是能够算出保险的成本。当他在一个城市和一个公共事业单位之间签订了这个国家现有的最好的合同时，对天然气业务的明确掌握是必不可少的——当然，还要结合使政治家的智慧和原创性。如果这个新想法不是建立在对服装行业状况的精确了解上，他就不可能发明优惠店。当他在美国最高法院面前确立了只针对妇女的立法的合宪性时，他所依赖的是理性，而不是对妇女过劳时实际发生的情况所显示的知识量——这虽然不是算术上的，但也是建立在同样的智力品质之上的。在梅伦先生从纽黑文铁路公司辞职的近两年前，布兰代斯先生给本报现任编辑写了一封私人信件，他在信中说。
   </p>
   <p>
   『当纽黑文减少其股息和梅伦辞职时，「纽黑文的衰落和梅伦的堕落」将成为一个关于人类利益的戏剧性故事，其中包括证明垄断的弊端，或者两个。事件不可能被长期推迟，你可能要为它们的到来做准备。
   </p>
   <p>
   『对未来有一点预期，我建议将以下内容作为墓志铭或讣告的内容。
   </p>
   <p>
   『梅伦是一个高明的人，富有同情心，有勇气，视野开阔。他激发了新英格兰的想象力；但是，由于视野狭窄，只是破坏了它的判断力，使它的良知变得沉默。有一段时间，他肆无忌惮地践踏人类和神圣的法律；但是，由于他沉迷于 「二加二等于五」的错觉，他最终沦为卑微的算术规则的受害者。
   </p>
   <p>
   『「陌生人啊，请记住，算术是科学之首，是安全之母。」』
   </p>
   <p>
   对纽黑文铁路不良财务管理的揭露，比其他任何一件事都更能使全国各地的大企业的浪费方法得到揭露和理解，而对纽黑文铁路的揭露几乎是布兰代斯先生的一手之劳。他是一个在需要战斗的时候不顾一切地战斗、一旦胜利就立即停止战斗的人。在很长一段时间里，非常值得尊敬和诚实的金融界领导人说，他对纽黑文的指控是不可靠和不可原谅的。他继续前进。然而，在真正的崩溃到来的前一年，他不再担心，因为他知道这项工作已经进行了很久，足以完成自己。当有人要求他在崩溃前不久参加一些小的争论时，他回答说：『那场斗争已不再需要我，时间和算术会解决剩下的问题』。
   </p>
   <p>
   在布兰代斯先生身上，这种对具体事物的把握与对方位和意义的同样杰出的把握相结合。他的想象力和他对商业的理解一样值得注意。在那些使他在美国生活中占有一席之地的成就中，他头脑中的两面都在一起工作。煤气公司和波士顿市之间的安排基于布兰代斯先生一生的指导原则之一，即任何合同如果对合同双方都不有利，那就是好的。在他对获得保险的方法和对劳动者的适当职位的理解背后，是一种对社会的纤维和能量的巨大优势的哲学，这种优势将来自于设计一些方法，使劳动阶级能够在他们的整个生活中使自己变得舒适，从而可能使国家帮助的复杂系统变得不必要。阿姆斯特朗委员会关于保险的报告中提出的最重要的观点是由布兰代斯先生作为Equitable保单持有人的顾问而提出的。在纽约议定书的管理中，商业和更重要的政治家精神是紧密结合在一起的，它为改善服装业的条件做出了巨大贡献。在布兰代斯先生看来，劳动者的福利及其与雇主的关系，就像今天所有最有能力的思想家一样，构成了我们必须解决的最重要的问题，他赢得了从俄勒冈州到美国最高法院的案件，确立了对妇女的特别保护立法的合宪性。在即将由最高法院审理的俄勒冈州的最低工资案中，他提出了限制妇女在某些行业的工作时间的逻辑顺序，因为限制她们的工作时间，然后允许她们的工资因此而被削减，这将是一种徒劳的表现。这些工业活动在很大程度上体现了他对劳动人民的深切同情和不断增长的理解.。弗洛伦斯-凯利曾经说过 『自林肯以来，没有一个人像路易斯-布兰代斯那样理解普通人』。
   </p>
   <p>
   虽然布兰代斯先生的大部分伟大的进步成就都与工业体系有关，但有些成就在更有限的意义上是政治性的。我与他一起工作，经历了巴林格-平肖（Ballinger-Pinchot）的争论，我从未见过对细节的把握与高度建设性的道德和政治思想结合得如此出色的人。在最了解内政部细节的人被布兰代斯先生盘问后，他来到我身边坐下说：『哈普古德先生，我对你毫无敬意。我不认为你在这次煽动中的动机是好的动机，但我想说，你有一个出色的律师。他今天对内政部的了解和我一样多』。在那场争论中，政府和参众两院的执政力量联合起来，保护巴林格部长，阻止真相的曝光。布兰代斯先生在领导斗争或保护一方时，一直被这样的想法所困扰，即某处有一个谜团。上面印制的社论暗示了他是如何解开这个谜团的，但这需要更多的篇幅来讲述其他方面的情况，对保护工作的热情，对提高任职标准的令人信服的论点，以及这一阴谋与国家更大需求的联系。在一次听证会上，很少有听众像布兰代斯先生对委员会的最后恳求那样被感动。
   </p>
   <p>
   他在铁路方面的工作可能会成为布兰代斯先生所做的许多事情中最重要的一项。1910年至1911年，他在州际商业委员会面前反对提高费率，理由是『铁路越繁荣，社会越有效』，这使『效率』一词成为全国性的概念。他的哲学中的一个重要观点是，朝着更高的国民生活的唯一真正进步将来自于我们所有活动中的『效率』。1913年12月，州际商业委员会向铁路公司提出的78个问题，体现了他在这个问题上的思想的最全面体现。
   </p>
   <p>
   他最努力的工作莫过于对货币信托基金的诊断，当他的一生被写出来时（我希望在很多年后），这将与他的铁路工作一起被列为加速工业变革的影响。他所爭取的這麼多東西都實現了，這確實不只是一個巧合。很少有一个人把一个想法，更不用说许多想法，有效地展现在世界面前，但可以毫不夸张地说，布兰代斯先生对现在广泛承认巨大规模的内在弱点负有责任。他是第一个有效地提出最大效率的规模是有限度的学说的人，而对这一真理的成功证明是对信托问题的深刻贡献。他在1911年对参议院委员会的证词中有力地证明了这一点，而在本卷中也有力地证明了这一点。在摧毁效率是规模的共同事件的错觉时，他强调了通过个人的密集发展来实现效率的可能性，从而将这一原则与他对效率的整个研究联系起来，并为工业民主指明了方向。
   </p>
   <p>
   与布兰代斯先生的工作中所体现出的智力和建设性能力相比，其卓越的道德品质同样值得注意。任何强大的、完全真诚的讨伐者都必须做出很多牺牲。布兰代斯先生在金钱、社会生活的舒适性和努力方面做出了很多牺牲，他是为了原则和人类的幸福。他高强度工作的能力、他持续的兴趣和意志，以及他的勇气都是领导者所必需的。如果没有人愿意为实现他的梦想而奉献自己的生命，就不可能做到他所做的一切。
   </p>
   <p>
   任何人都不应该因为布兰代斯先生和其他人的劳动最近带来了变化而误认为正在受到攻击的制度已经被破坏了。货币法案已经通过，在写下这些文字的时候，看起来似乎有一组信托法案将被通过。但制度不是一天就能结束的。在本书所印的文章中所体现的真理中，有一些现在正在实施，但要使整个思想生效还需要很多很多年；因此，在很多很多年里，积极的公民将为这些原则而奋斗，这些原则在这里被如此清楚、如此雄辩、如此确凿地阐述出来。

   第一章：我们的金融寡头制度
   </h1>
   <p>
   威尔逊总统在1911年担任州长时宣布：
   </p>
   <p>
   『在这个国家，最大的垄断是货币垄断。只要这种垄断存在，我们过去的多样性、自由和个人发展的能量就不可能存在。一个伟大的工业国家是由其信贷系统控制的。我们的信贷系统是集中的。因此，国家的发展和我们的所有活动都掌握在少数人手中，即使他们的行为是诚实的，是为了公共利益，但他们必然集中在他们自己的钱所涉及的伟大事业上，而且，由于他们自身的各种限制，他们必然会扼杀、审查和破坏真正的经济自由。这是所有问题中最重要的问题；对于这个问题，政治家们必须以真诚的决心来解决，为人类的长远发展和真正的自由服务。』
   </p>
   <p>
   1912年任命的普约委员会（Pujo Committee）发现：
   </p>
   <p>
   『比过去发生在我们身上的所有消除工业竞争的方式更危险的是通过这些集团对我们的银行和工业的支配来控制信贷』……
   </p>
   <p>
   『如果我们的银行继续被一个小集团控制，那么在不同的货币体系下，我们银行的资源是多了还是少了，相对来说并不重要。』……
   </p>
   <p>
   『在这些少数银行家和他们的伙伴及盟友手中，不可能出现与所有筹集资金或出售大量债券的设施竞争的情况，他们共同支配着大多数现有制度的金融政策。……然而，正如这里所描述的那样，这个内部集团的行为对竞争的破坏性比信托公司所完成的任何事情都要大，因为它们打击了受其保护的每个行业的潜在竞争的要害，这种情况如果允许继续下去，将使恢复工业界正常竞争条件的所有尝试成为不可能。……
   </p>
   <p>
   『如果现在因这些集团的控制而造成的障碍所堵塞的信贷动脉被打开，使它们可以自由地在金融系统中发挥其重要作用，大型企业的竞争将成为可能，商业可以根据其优点进行，而不是受制于这一小撮自封的国家繁荣受托人的贡品和善意。』
   </p>
   <p>
   新自由的承诺在1913年被欣然宣布。
   </p>
   <p>
   普约调查委员会及其干练的律师塞缪尔 · 昂特米尔（Samuel Untermyer）先生向全国展示的事实，清楚地表明了少数人控制美国商业的手段。该报告提出了一些措施，有望得到一些缓解。还将提出更多的补救措施。国会将很快被要求采取行动。
   </p>
   <p>
   应如何实现解放？我们应从哪些方面着手？当充分了解事实后，我们就会知道。
   </p>
   <h2>
   主导因素
   </h2>
   <p>
   我们的金融寡头中的主导因素是投资银行家。联营银行、信托公司和人寿保险公司是他的工具。被控制的铁路、公共服务和工业公司是他的对象。这些银行家虽然只是中间人，但却以主人的姿态包围着美国的商业世界，因此，如果没有他们的参与或批准，几乎没有任何大型企业可以成功开展。当然，这些银行家是拥有巨额财富的能人；但他们控制商业的最有力因素不是拥有非凡的能力或巨大的财富。他们权力的关键是如下组合：紧密的、全面的集中。分别在三条不同的路线上推进：
   </p>
   <p>
   首先：银行和信托公司的明显合并；不太明显的附属关系——通过持股、投票信托和互锁的董事会——没有法律关系的银行机构；以及联合交易、君子协定和消除投资银行家之间竞争的 "银行伦理”。
   </p>
   <p>
   第二：铁路合并成巨大的系统，公共服务公司的大型组合和工业信托的形成，通过使企业变得如此『大』，以至于当地独立的银行企业无法单独提供必要的资金，这造成了对相关纽约银行家的依赖。
   </p>
   <p>
   但是，仅仅沿着这些路线的组合，无论多么密集，都不可能产生货币信托基金——那么我们需要加入另一个更有力的组合因素。
   </p>
   <p>
   第三：投资银行家，如J.P.Morgan & Co.，债券、股票和票据的交易商，侵占了其他三类公司的职能，他们的业务使他们接触到这些公司。他们成为铁路、公共服务和工业公司的指挥者，我们的大型商业活动都是通过这些公司进行的——债券和股票的制造者。他们成为人寿保险公司和其他人民储蓄库的指导力量——债券和股票的买家。他们也成为银行和信托公司的指挥者——国家快速资本的存放者——商业的生命之血，他们和其他人用它开展业务。因此，四种不同的职能，每一种都是商业所必需的，而且每一种都是由一组不同的人行使的，在投资银行家身上得到了结合。正是由于这种商业功能的结合，货币信托的存在才是主要原因。(显然，只有少数投资银行家行使这个巨大的权力；但其他許多人在这个系统中发挥着重要的作用，如下所述）。
   </p>
   <p>
   在这方面，我们的金融寡头的发展遵循了政治专制主义的历史让我们熟悉的路线：『篡夺』通过逐步蚕食、而不是通过暴力行动进行；微妙的，往往是长期隐藏的不同职能的集中，这些职能在单独管理时是有益的，只有在合并在同一个人身上时才是危险的。正是通过这样的过程，凯撒 · 奥古斯都成为罗马的主人。我们自己宪法的制定者在如此谨慎地规定政府权力的分离时，也考虑到了对我们政治自由的类似危险。
   </p>
   <h2>
   投资银行家的适当范围
   </h2>
   <p>
   投资银行家的最初职能是债券、股票和票据的交易商；主要从需要资金的公司、市政当局、州和政府那里批发购买，然后卖给寻求投资的人。在这方面，银行家履行的是商人的职能；而且这种职能是非常有用的。大型商业企业一般由公司经营。公司的永久资本由债券和股票代表。更重要的公司的债券和股票在很大程度上由小投资者拥有，他们不参与公司的管理。公司需要银行家（即『中间人』）的帮助，因为他们通常缺乏直接向投资者出售自己的债券和股票所必需的声誉和客户。公司证券的投资者也需要银行家中间人的服务。市场上的证券数量非常多。这些证券中只有一部分在纽约证券交易所上市；但仅其上市就包括约1600个不同的问题，总额约为265亿美元，而且每年新上市的证券平均约为230个，金额为15亿美元。对于一个小投资者来说，从这些众多的公司证券中做出明智的选择--事实上，对一个单一的证券做出明智的判断--通常是不可能的。他缺乏适当调查所必需的能力、设施、培训和时间。除非他的购买比赌博好一点，否则他需要专家的建议，专家将专业知识与判断力相结合，拥有进行彻底调查的设施和动力。近年来，公司和投资者对银行家的这种依赖性越来越强，因为妇女和其他不参与管理的人已经成为我们大公司的很大一部分股票和债券的所有者。美国炼糖公司一半以上的股东和宾夕法尼亚铁路以及纽约、纽黑文和哈特福德铁路近一半的股东是妇女。
   </p>
   <p>
   商誉（商业信誉）始终是商业活动中的一个重要因素，经销商拥有着众多有价值的老客户。但在销售债券和股票的业务中，它具有特殊的价值，原因就在于小投资者在很大程度上依赖于银行家的判断。银行家与客户的这种保密关系（以及附带获得的对客户私人事务的了解）往往是证券营销中的一个决定性因素。随着大商业的到来，老牌银行所拥有的这种善意，尤其是J.P.Morgan & Co.及其费城的Drexel & Co.，波士顿的Lee, Higginson & Co.和Kidder, Peabody, & Co.，以及纽约的Kuhn, Loeb & Co.，变得更加重要。由于巨大的铁路合并、控股公司的发展，特别是工业信托的形成，新的证券发行量大大增加。美国人民迅速积累的储蓄寻求投资。因此，证券交易商的业务领域大大扩大了。而且，由于证券是新的和未经试验的，投资银行家的服务需求很大，他的权力和利润也相应增加。
   </p>
   <h2>
   控制证券商
   </h2>
   <p>
   但是，投资银行家对其合法业务领域的这种扩大并不满意。他们并不满足于仅仅进行证券交易。他们还希望制造这些证券。他们成为促销员，或与促销员结盟。因此，J.P.摩根公司成立了钢铁信托公司、收割机信托公司和航运信托公司。而且，在助产士的职责之外，投资银行家们还在公司发生灾难时成为证券持有人 "保护委员会 "的成员；然后他们作为 "重组经理 "参与到不成功公司的重组中，并最终成为董事。正是通过这种方式，摩根的合伙人获得了对南方铁路公司、北太平洋公司、雷丁公司、伊利公司、马凯特公司、芝加哥和大西部公司以及辛辛那提、汉密尔顿和代顿公司的控制权。他们常常通过投票权信托的手段来保证这种控制权的持续；但即使在没有设立投票权信托的地方，在重组时也能获得安全的控制权。Kuhn, Loeb & Co.公司也是通过这种方式在联合太平洋公司和巴尔的摩和俄亥俄州的公司中发挥了作用。
   </p>
   <p>
   但是，银行家对公司管理的参与并不限于促进或重组的情况。对新资金的紧急或广泛需求被认为是银行家进入董事会的充分理由。通常情况下，即使没有这样的借口，投资银行家也能通过其强大的影响力或对其客户代理人的控制，在董事会中获得一席之地。摩根先生在1892年进入当时繁荣的纽约、纽黑文和哈特福德铁路公司的管理层，似乎就是这种情况。不管是在什么情况下，一旦银行家进入董事会，通常他的控制力是超强的，他的影响力是最高的；因为他控制着新资金的供应。
   </p>
   <p>
   投资银行家自然是在寻找债券和股票的便宜货。像其他商人一样，他想廉价购买他的商品。但是，当他成为一家公司的董事时，他所处的位置使他获得公司证券的交易不能被正确地称为讨价还价。在交易双方都是同一个人的情况下，还会有真正的讨价还价吗？投资银行家通过他在董事会的控制性影响，决定公司发行和出售证券，决定出售证券的价格，并决定将证券卖给他自己。除银行家外，董事会中还有其他董事，但在实践中并不能阻止这种结果的发生。握有钱袋的银行家通常成为主导的精神。通过投票托管、专属财务机构、执行委员会或财务委员会的成员资格，或仅仅是董事职位，J.P.摩根公司及其合伙人在至少32家运输系统、公用事业公司和工业公司中拥有这样的财务权力，这些公司的总资本额为172.73亿美元。J.P.摩根公司主要为这些被控制的公司，在十年内促成了总额为19.5亿美元的证券发行的公开销售。这笔巨款并不包括任何私下销售的问题，也不包括州内公司的任何问题，无论如何销售。Kuhn, Loeb & Co.公司和其他一些投资银行家对许多其他公司进行了类似的控制。

   对铁路、公共服务和工业公司的这种控制，保证了投资银行家们以有吸引力的价格获得充足的证券供应；而且商品买得好，卖得也快。但是，这些债券和股票商人并不愿意为他们推销商品的能力承担哪怕是一点点风险。他们看到，如果他们能够控制证券购买者和证券制造者，投资银行确实会成为 『一个快乐的狩猎场』；他们已经使其成为这样。
   </p>
   <p>
   从严格意义上讲，众多的小投资者无法被控制；但他们对银行家的依赖性保证了他们会受到适当的影响。然而，所有发行的债券和许多股票的很大一部分是由著名的公司投资者购买的；其中最突出的是人寿保险公司、信托公司和银行。这些机构购买证券，不仅使银行家摆脱了商品，而且向小投资者大力推荐，因为他们相信这些机构的管理是明智的。这些受控的公司投资者不仅是大客户，而且可能是特别包容的客户。个人投资者是喜怒无常的。他们只在自己想买的时候才买。他们有时很不情愿。公司投资者，如果得到控制，可以在银行家需要市场的时候让他们购买。很自然，投资银行家们开始控制大型人寿保险公司，以及信托公司和银行。
   </p>
   <p>
   这样占据的领域是非常丰富的。寿险公司是我们主要的储蓄机构。他们巨大的盈余和储备，每天都在增加，总是吵着要投资。任何恐慌或资金短缺都不会阻止新的资金从现有保单的保费和现有投资的利息的常年流中流入。三家大公司（纽约人寿、纽约互助会和平等会）即使不发一张新保单，每年也有超过5500万美元的新资金可以投资。1904年，就在阿姆斯特朗调查之前，这三家公司总共拥有1,247,331,738.18美元的资产。在这一年，他们发行了1,025,671,126美元的新保单。纽约立法机构在1906年对它们的增长施加了某些限制；因此，它们的新业务从那时起平均为547,384,212美元，或只有1904年的53%。但是这些公司的总资产在过去八年中增加到1,817,052,260.36美元。在阿姆斯特朗调查时，这三家公司的平均年龄是五十六岁。在过去的八年中，资产的增长大约是之前五十六年总增长的一半。这三家公司每年必须投资约700万美元的新资金；此外，许多旧的投资过期或被改变，收益必须重新投资。所有人寿保险盈余和储备金的很大一部分都投资于债券。1913年1月1日，这三家公司的债券投资总额为1,019,153,268.93美元。
   </p>
   <p>
   投资银行家们自然要设法控制这些永不衰竭的资本库。乔治 · W · 帕金斯（George W. Perkins）是纽约人寿的副总裁，这是最大的公司。在担任副主席期间，他被任命为摩根公司的合伙人，在阿姆斯特朗调查之前的四年里，他的公司向纽约人寿出售了38,804,918.51美元的证券。纽约人寿是一家互助公司，应该由其保单持有人控制。但正如普约委员会所发现的，『所谓的保单持有人通过互助化控制人寿保险公司是一场闹剧』，『其唯一的结果是让一个自我成立、自我延续的管理层继续任职』。
   </p>
   <p>
   平等人寿保险协会（Equitable Life Assurance）是一家股票公司，由100,000美元的股票控制。法律规定这种股票的股息不得超过7%；但在1910年，摩根先生为这种股票的面值51,000美元支付了约3,000,000美元，即每股5,882.35美元。股票投资的股息回报率不到八分之一；但现在控制的资产达到了500,000,000美元以上。而这些资产中的某些资产对投资银行家来说具有特殊的价值；即大量持有银行和信托公司的股票。
   </p>
   <p>
   阿姆斯特朗的调查披露了通过保险公司持有的银行和信托公司股票所施加的金融力量的程度。委员会建议立法，迫使保险公司在五年内处置这些股票。为此颁布了一项法律，但时间后来被延长。然后，这些公司处理了一部分银行和信托公司的股票；但是，由于保险公司是由投资银行家控制的，这些先生把银行和信托公司的股票卖给了他们自己。
   </p>
   <p>
   提到从互助人寿（Mutual Life）以及公平公司（the Equitable）的这种购买，普约委员会发现：
   </p>
   <p>
   『那么，这里有五家重要的信托公司和我们在纽约市最大的一家国家银行的股票被这两家人寿保险公司持有。在五年内，所有这些股票，只要是由保险公司分配的，都发现它们落入了那些实际上控制或与保险公司管理层有关系的人或他们的亲密盟友和同伙手中，在这种程度上，从而进一步巩固了他们的地位。』
   </p>
   <p>
   银行和信托公司主要不是人民储蓄的存放者，而是商业人士快速资本的存放者。然而，自从投资银行家获得银行和信托公司的控制权后，这些机构也像人寿公司一样，成为债券和股票的大买家。我们的许多国家银行都以这种方式投资了它们所有资源的很大一部分，包括资本、盈余和存款。一些银行的债券投资远远超过其资本和盈余的总和，几乎等于其可用于放贷的存款额。
   </p>
   <h2>
   控制他人的快速资本（Quick Capital）
   </h2>
   <p>
   下金蛋的鹅一直被认为是最有价值的财产。但更有利可图的是这种特权：拿别人的鹅下的金蛋。投资银行家和他们的同伙现在享有这种特权。他们通过人民自己的钱来控制人民。如果银行家的权力只与他们的财富相称，他们对美国商业的影响就会相对较小。像阿斯特家族那样的巨额财富无疑是令人遗憾的。它们与民主不一致。它们不符合社会要求。当它们代表着大部分不劳而获的增量时，它们显得特别不公正。但阿斯特家族的财富并不危及政治或工业自由。与美国甚至是纽约市的财富总量相比，它的数额微不足道。它缺乏重要性，主要是因为它的所有者只有来自他们自己财富的收入。阿斯特的财富是静态的。摩根合伙人的财富是动态的。我们金融寡头的权力和权力的增长来自于挥舞他人的储蓄和快速资本。在三大人寿保险公司中的两家，J.P.Morgan & Co.及其合伙人的影响力是在没有任何个人投资的情况下发挥出来的。即使在公平公司（the Equitable），摩根先生购买了所有流通股票的实际多数，他的投资也只占公司资产的二分之一。束缚人民的枷锁是由人民自己的黄金铸造的。
   </p>
   <p>
   但是，投资银行家们现在从中获取最大权力的其他人的资金库，不是人寿保险公司，而是银行和信托公司。银行存款代表了国家的真正快速资本。它们是企业的生命之血。它们的有效力量比同等数量的永久性投资财富的力量要大得多。普约委员会宣布由摩根合伙人直接控制的34家银行和信托公司，持有19.83亿美元的存款。对这些机构的控制意味着有能力将这些资金的很大一部分直接或间接地借给自己；而且往往更重要的是，有能力阻止这些资金借给任何竞争对手的利益。这些巨额存款，在控制者的斟酌下，可以用来满足其主体公司的临时需要。当债券和股票被发行以永久资助这些公司时，银行存款可以在很大程度上被控制的投资银行家借给他们自己和他们的合伙人；因此，买来的证券可以由他们携带，直到卖给投资者。或者，这些银行存款可以借给联盟银行家、证券商或投机者，使他们能够持有债券或股票。宽松的货币倾向于使市场上的证券上涨。紧缩的货币几乎总是使它们下跌。主要的投资银行家对银行和信托公司的控制是如此之大，以至于他们经常可以通过在证券交易所放贷或拒绝放贷来暂时决定货币市场。通过这种方式，他们有能力影响债券和股票价格的总体趋势。他们对某一特定证券的权力甚至更大。它在市场上的销售可能取决于该证券在提供给银行和信托公司作为贷款的抵押品时是否受到青睐或被歧视。
   </p>
   <p>
   此外，正是由于投资银行家能够在受控银行和信托公司中获得其他人的资金，才使得任何一家银行企业能够在债券和股票的年度产出中占据如此大的比重。银行家自己的资本，无论多么庞大，都会很快被耗尽。如果不是银行家控制的人寿保险、铁路、公共服务和工业公司在这些银行的大量存款，甚至银行的可贷资金也会经常耗尽。1912年12月31日，三大人寿保险公司在银行和信托公司的存款总额为13,839,189.08美元。正如普约委员会所发现的：
   </p>
   <p>
   『那些通过控制我们的铁路和工业公司的资金，能够指导这些资金的存放地点，从而创造这些巨大的人民资金库的人，是那些能够为他们感兴趣的企业挖掘这些资金库，并防止它们被用于他们不赞成的目的的人。后者是与前者同样重要的因素。在对铁路和工业界的竞争的影响方面，它是一个控制性的考虑。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   拿走你的蛋糕，而且还要吃掉
   </h2>
   <p>
   但是，投资银行家对其他人的钱的权力往往比通过受控银行和信托公司施加的权力更直接和有效。摩根公司（J. P. Morgan & Co.）实现了所谓的不可能的壮举——拿走了别人的蛋糕而且还把蛋糕吃掉了。他们购买被控制的铁路和工业企业的债券和股票，并支付购买价格；而且仍然不放弃他们的钱。这是通过成为受控公司的存款银行这一简单的手段来实现的，而不是让公司在一些仅仅受控的银行里存款，而其他人至少在这些银行里有一些份额。当J.P.Morgan & Co.公司购买一批证券时，购买的钱不是支付给公司，而是由银行家为公司保留，只有在公司需要资金时才会提取。由于证券是分批发行的，而且募集的资金往往在很久之后才全部用完，所以留在银行家手中的余额总数是巨大的。因此，J.P. Morgan & Co. (包括他们在费城的机构，称为Drexel & Co.）在1912年11月1日持有的存款总额为162,491,819.65美元。
   </p>
   <h2>
   权力与不义之财
   </h2>
   <p>
   如此全面的集中系统的运作必然会在银行家身上形成过大的权力。而银行家的权力是靠它的食物来增长的。权力产生财富；而更多的财富为获得财富和权力提供了新的机会。这些银行家的业务是如此庞大和众多，即使对银行家所提供的服务给予非常合理的补偿，也会为他们带来如此巨大的收入，从而导致资本的巨大积累。但是，银行家们作为佣金或利润所获得的报酬往往远非合理。他们经常处于既是卖方又是买方的不一致地位，实际应用的所谓报酬标准不是 "合理规则"，而是 "所有的交通将承担"。即使在没有险恶动机的情况下也是如此。人性的弱点使人们不能很好地判断自己的价值。
   </p>
   <p>
   J.P.摩根公司组成的银团为美国钢铁公司提供了服务，其证券净值为62,500,000美元的现金。在这笔巨款中，J.P.摩根公司作为银团经理，除了他们作为银团成员有权得到的份额外，还得到了1250万美元。这62,500,000美元只是为垄断钢铁业而支付的部分费用。除了专门为组织美国钢铁公司而收取的佣金外，还为组织它所组成的几家公司支付了大量的费用。例如，国家钢管公司的资本为80,000,000美元的股票；其中40,000,000美元是普通股票。这44,000,000美元中的一半被J.P.摩根公司和他们的合伙人拿去做推广服务；而这样拿去的20,000,000美元的股票后来可以交换成25,000,000美元的钢铁普通股。公司事务专员赫伯特 · 诺克斯 · 史密斯发现：
   </p>
   <p>
   『超过150,000,000美元的钢铁公司股票被直接或间接（通过交换）发行，仅仅是为了促销或承销服务。换句话说，钢铁公司总股本的近七分之一似乎是直接或间接发行给促销员的服务。』
   </p>
   <p>
   银行家和合伙人在组织信托基金时收取的所谓费用和佣金特别多。但即使在信托公司成功启动后，银行家们的索取也往往是敲诈性的。1901年，为钢铁公司的优先股转换计划提供担保的银团只预付了20,000,000美元的现金，并获得了6,800,000美元的承销佣金。
   </p>
   <p>
   征收巨额佣金的情况并不局限于信托和其他工业企业。英特伯勒铁路公司是一个非常繁荣的公司。它去年在其股本上获得了近21%的收益，并从纽约市获得了与地铁扩建有关的非常有利的合同。但是，当它为其170,000,000美元的债券发行融资时，人们同意J.P.Morgan & Co.应获得3%的收益，即5,100,000美元，因为它只是组建了这个银团。最近，纽约、纽黑文和哈特福德铁路公司同意向J.P.摩根公司支付1,680,000美元的佣金，即2.5%，以组成银团，按面值承销67,000,000美元的20年期6%可转换债券的发行。这意味着，银行家们承诺以97又1/2的价格购买任何这些6%的可转换债券，而股东可能不愿意以100的价格购买。签订合同时，纽黑文公司当时尚未发行的6%的可转换债券的售价为114美元。而新发行的债券一经公布，就受到了极大的追捧，公众提出并在数月内愿意以106美元的价格购买该公司将支付给J.P.Morgan & Co.的1,680,000美元的债券，并愿意按面值购买。
   </p>
   <h2>
   为什么银行会成为投资银行家
   </h2>
   <p>
   这些来自促销、承销和证券购买的巨额利润导致了我们主要银行机构的行为发生了革命性的变化。很明显，投资银行家对银行和信托公司存款的控制是他们获得这些巨额利润的一个重要因素。银行官员们自然会问：『为什么银行和信托公司不应该分享如此有利可图的领域？为什么他们自己不应该成为投资银行家，拥有 「大生意」所带来的所有新功能？』这样做就会脱离银行业务的合法范围，也就是向商业公司提供临时贷款。但这种诱惑是不可抗拒的。投资银行家对银行业务领域的入侵，随之而来的是银行对投资银行家领域的反入侵。在这些银行中，最突出的是纽约的国家城和第一国家银行。但他们的入侵并不是敌对的入侵。竞争的力量作为盟友相遇，联手控制国家的商业，并『分赃』。这一联盟通过投票信托、互锁的董事机构和共同所有权而得到巩固。结果是最充分的『合作』，越来越多的铁路、公共服务公司和工业企业被完全控制住了。
   </p>
   <h1>
   第二章：联合者如何进行联合？
   </h1>
   <p>
   在盟友中，纽约有两家地位显赫的银行：『国家城市银行』和『第一国家银行』，它们与摩根公司一起构成了货币信托公司的内部集团。这两家银行和J.P.摩根公司一样，都拥有巨大的资源。这两家银行中的每一家，就像J.P. Morgan & Co.公司一样，都被一个天才的组合所支配。在国家城银行（Na­tional City），是詹姆斯 · 斯蒂尔曼（James Stillman）；在第一国家银行，是乔治 · F · 贝克（George F. Baker）。这两位先生以前都是总裁，现在都是董事会主席。国家城市银行的资源（包括其连体安全公司，Siamese-twin security company）约为3亿美元；第一国民银行的资源（包括其连体安全公司，Siamese-twin security company）约为2亿美元。摩根公司的资源还没有被披露。但是，他们似乎也有来自其主体的巨额存款可供经营；据报道，存款为16250万美元。
   </p>
   <p>
   合并中的主要参与者的私人财富没有得到确认。但零星的证据表明，当一个人使用 『别人的钱』时，其积累的可能性是多么巨大。摩根先生的财富已成为众所周知的事情。在斯蒂尔曼先生的众多投资中，只有一项被特别提及，因为他在调查期间在欧洲没有去作证，但这一项非常重要。他在国家城市银行的47,498股股票价值约为18,000,000美元。雅各布 · H · 斯奇夫（Jacob H. Schiff）先生恰当地将其描述为『一项非常好的投资』。
   </p>
   <p>
   关于贝克先生的投资，我们知道得更多，因为他就许多问题作证。他在第一国民银行的20,000股股票至少价值20,000,000美元。他在其他六家纽约银行和信托公司的股票总共价值约300万美元。他在铁路方面的投资规模可以从他以前在新泽西中央铁路的持股中推断出来。他是该公司最大的股东，以至于他和几个朋友持有面值27,436,800美元的流通股中的大多数，雷丁公司以每股160美元的价格购买了这些股票。他是其他28家铁路公司的董事；据推测，他是至少同样多公司的股东。他的全部财产没有被调查，因为这不是调查中的一个问题。但是，贝克先生认为没有必要制定新的法律，这一点并不令人惊讶。当被问及：
   </p>
   <p>
   『你认为这个世界上的一切都很好，是吗？』
   </p>
   <p>
   他回答说：『差不多。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   权力的影响
   </h2>
   <p>
   但用数字表示的财富完全不能说明盟国的力量。他们的财富是动态的。它是由天才们共同挥舞的。它在控制手段中找到适当的表达。为了理解盟国的力量，我们必须尝试将这些力量的运作方式可视化。
   </p>
   <p>
   贝克先生是22家公司的董事，这些公司连同它们的许多子公司，总资源或资本化为72.72亿美元。但贝克先生主宰的第一国民银行的直接和可见的权力还在延伸。普约委员会报告显示，该银行的董事（包括贝克先生的儿子）至少是其他27家公司的董事，其资源为42.7亿美元。也就是说，第一国民银行在49家公司中有代表，总资源或资本化为115.42亿美元。
   </p>
   <p>
   举例来说，贝克先生在其中作为投票受托人、执行委员会成员或简单的董事，明显而直接地施加了影响，这可能有助于对盟友的权力的理解。
   </p>
   <p>
   1. 银行、信托和人寿保险公司：纽约第一国民银行；国家商业银行；农民贷款和信托公司；互助人寿保险公司。
   </p>
   <p>
   2. 铁路公司：纽约中央铁路公司；纽黑文、雷丁、伊利、拉卡万纳、利哈伊谷、南方、北太平洋、芝加哥、伯林顿和昆西。
   </p>
   <p>
   3. 公共服务公司：美国电报和电话公司，亚当斯快递公司。
   </p>
   <p>
   4. 工业公司：美国钢铁公司，普尔曼公司。
   </p>
   <p>
   斯蒂尔曼先生仅是7家公司的董事，总资产为24.76亿美元；但他主导的国家城市银行的董事至少是其他41家公司的董事，这些公司及其子公司的总资本或资源为105.64亿美元。摩根公司（J. P, Morgan & Co.）的成员是公认的联盟力量的领导者，他们在全国最大的47家公司中担任72个董事职位。
   </p>
   <p>
   普约委员会发现，J.P.摩根公司的成员和他们控制的信托公司以及第一国民银行和国民城市银行的董事共同持有。
   </p>
   <p>
   『在34家银行和信托公司中担任118个董事职位，其资源总额为26.79亿美元，存款总额为19.83亿美元。
   </p>
   <p>
   『在10家保险公司担任30个董事职位，总资产为22.93亿美元。
   </p>
   <p>
   『在32个运输系统中担任125个董事职位，其资本总额为117.84亿美元，总里程数（不包括快递公司和蒸汽船公司）为150,200。

   『在24家生产和贸易公司中担任63个董事职位，其资本总额为3,339,000,000美元。
   </p>
   <p>
   『在12家公共事业公司中担任25个董事职位，总资本额为21.5亿美元。
   </p>

   『总的来说，在112家公司中担任341个董事职位，其资源或资本总额为22,245,000,000美元』
   </p>
   <h2>
   二百二十亿美金
   </h2>
   <p>
   二百二十亿美元是一个大数目，大到我们难以把握其意义。心灵只有通过比较才能意识到规模。我们能用什么来比较二百二十亿美元呢？二百二十亿美元是整个新英格兰地区所有财产（不动产和个人财产）评估价值的三倍多。它几乎是纽约市所有房地产评估价值的三倍。它是南方13个州所有财产评估价值的两倍多。它超过了位于密西西比河以西的南北22个州的所有财产的评估价值。
   </p>
   <p>
   但是，二百二十亿美元的巨款还不足以包括这三个盟友的『影响力』直接和明显地延伸到的所有公司，因为：
   </p>
   <p>
   第一：还有56家公司（未包括在普约表内），每家公司的资本或资源都超过500万美元，总额接近13.5亿美元，根据董事名录，摩根盟友在这些公司中有代表。
   </p>
   <p>
   第二：普约表不包括任何资源低于500万美元的公司。但这些金融巨头通过成为许多这样的公司的董事来显示他们的谦逊。例如，J.P.摩根公司的成员，以及国家城市银行和第一国家银行的董事也是158家此类公司的董事。现有出版物只披露了其中38家公司的资本额，但这38家公司的资本总额为78,669,375美元。
   </p>
   <p>
   第三：普约表只包括摩根合伙人实际以董事身份出现的公司。它不包括那些他们由虚拟人物或其他方式代表的公司。例如，摩根的影响力当然延伸到了堪萨斯城终点站铁路公司，自1910年以来，他们为该公司推销了四期债券，总额达41,761,000美元。但是，J.P.摩根公司、国家城市银行或第一国家银行的成员都没有出现在堪萨斯城终点站的董事会。
   </p>
   <p>
   第四：普约表并不包括表内公司的所有子公司。例如，纽黑文系统的资本化被列为385,000,000美元。这个数字代表纽黑文铁路公司的债券和股票资本。但纽黑文系统包括许多受控公司，这些公司的资本化只是在很小的程度上直接或间接地包括在纽黑文铁路的资产负债表中。像大多数大公司一样，纽黑文公司也是一家控股公司；而一家控股公司可以控制子公司，但只拥有后者的一小部分流通证券。在控股公司的资产负债表中，只有所持有的那一小部分会被体现出来。因此，虽然纽黑文铁路公司的资本化只有385,000,000美元，而且这个数字只出现在普约表上，但纽黑文系统的资本化是它的两倍以上（如提交给委员会的图表所示）即849,000,000美元。
   </p>
   <p>
   因此，很明显，普约委员会提到的22,000,000,000美元低估了货币信托公司内部集团所实现的集中程度。
   </p>
   <h2>
   巩固三国联盟
   </h2>
   <p>
   这些帝国权力的建设者们注意到他们的结构应该是持久的。联合所有权和相互持股以及密切的个人关系从各个方面支持了这个结构；因为董事职位是短暂的，可能随着新的选举而结束。摩根先生和他的合伙人获得了第一国家银行六分之一的股票，并对国家城市银行的股票进行了600万美元的投资。然后，J.P.摩根公司、国家城市银行和第一国家银行（或他们的主要官员：斯蒂尔曼先生和贝克先生）通过购买股票和投票信托共同获得了国家商业银行的控制权，该银行拥有1.9亿美元的资源；大通国家银行拥有1.25亿美元；担保信托公司拥有2.32亿美元；银行家信托公司拥有2.05亿美元；以及一些较小、但重要的金融机构。他们成为大型铁路系统的联合投票受托人；最后（就像盟友们联合起来成为一个单一的企业一样），他们在银行的忠诚和高效服务得到了晋升为J.P.摩根公司成员的奖励，就像戴维森先生和拉蒙特先生在第一国民银行所做的那样。
   </p>
   <h2>
   省级盟友
   </h2>
   <p>
   就这样，J.P.摩根公司、国民城市银行和第一国民银行轻松地主宰了美国的金融中心：纽约；因为某些其他重要的银行家被 『绅士 』协议所限制，这点我们将在下文中提到。这三个盟友也主宰了费城；因为德雷塞尔公司（Drexel & Co.）是摩根公司（J. P. Morgan & Co.）的另一个名字。但在美国还有两个重要的货币中心，即波士顿和芝加哥。
   </p>
   <p>
   在波士顿，有两家大型国际银行：李希金森公司和基德 · 皮博迪公司。这两家公司都成立已久，财力雄厚；每家公司都拥有广泛而富有的客户群，都是热衷于债券和股票的投资者。自1907年以来，这些公司中的每一家都购买或承销了（主要是与其他银行家合作）约100种大型州际公司的不同证券，每家银行家的发行总额超过10亿美元。银行业资本的集中在波士顿甚至比在纽约更进一步。通过连续的合并，国家银行的数量已经从1898年的58家减少到1913年的19家。在波士顿，现在还有23家信托公司。
   </p>
   <p>
   这两家波士顿银行及其合伙人控制的肖姆特国民银行、波士顿第一国民银行和老殖民地信托公司，仅资源总额就达288,386,294美元，约占该市银行资源的二分之一。这些伟大的银行机构本身就是多次合并的结果，还有其他21家银行和信托公司，它们的董事也是这些公司的董事，它们共同拥有波士顿银行资源总额的90％。因此，在42家银行机构中，有33家银行机构的资源总额为560,516,239美元，占波士顿银行资源总额的92.5%，是相互关联的。但是，即使是剩下的9家银行和信托公司，它们总共只持有波士顿银行资源的7.5%，也并非都是相互独立的。有三家是联系在一起的；因此，在整个波士顿，似乎只有六家银行不存在联锁的董事关系。它们总共只占波士顿银行资源的5%。即使是这6家银行，是否都完全没有与其他集团的关联，也是值得怀疑的。
   </p>
   <p>
   波士顿的银行业集中度并不局限于该市的合法范围内。在波士顿本土周围有30多个郊区，它们与波士顿一起构成了人们所熟知的 "大波士顿"。这些郊区城市，以及其他重要城市，如伍斯特（Worcester）和斯普林菲尔德（Springfield），在许多方面都在波士顿的 『影响范围』内。如上所述，波士顿的内部银行集团不仅将波士顿本土42家银行中的33家联锁起来，而且通过联锁的董事职位，将其他35个城市的至少42家银行和信托公司联系起来。
   </p>
   <p>
   李希金斯公司（Lee, Higginson & Co.）和基德皮博迪公司（Kidder, Peabody & Co.）两家曾经是积极的竞争对手。他们在一些小的或纯粹的地方性事务中仍然如此；但在较大的和州际的交易中，他们都是摩根公司的忠实合作者；与这些伟大的波士顿银行的联盟已经通过相互持股和共同担任董事而得到了巩固。金融集中度似乎在波士顿得到了最高的体现。
   </p>
   <p>
   三方联盟与芝加哥的大型金融机构之间存在类似的官司，这些大型金融机构包括『第一国民银行』、『伊利诺伊州信托和储蓄银行』以及『大陆和商业国民银行』，它们共同控制着5.61亿美元的资源。毫无疑问，与美国其他重要金融中心的主要银行家也存在类似的关系，但由于缺乏时间，普约委员会无法对其进行调查。
   </p>
   <h2>
   附属机构
   </h2>
   <p>
   这就是组成货币信托的主要和次要的力量；但这些力量得到了巨大的补充。
   </p>
   <p>
   普约委员会说：『从这些主要集团辐射出来的、与他们密切相关的是较小、但重要的银行机构，如Kissel, Kinnicut & Co., White, Weld & Co., 和Harvey Fisk & Sons，他们从主导集团获得大量有利可图的赞助，并被后者用作证券的零售商或分销商，他们控制这些证券的发行，但由于他们自己的原因不愿意以自己的名义发行或分销。李希金斯公司（Lee, Higginson & Co.）公司除了是内部集团的合作伙伴外，还经常被用于这项服务，因为他们作为证券分销商的设施。

   例如，J.P摩根公司作为纽黑文铁路公司的财务代理，有权推销其证券和其子公司的证券。在纽黑文的众多子公司中，有纽约、威彻斯特和波士顿--这条路的建造成本为每英里150万美元，去年的赤字接近150万美元，此外，纽黑文自己的股票和债券投资也没有获得任何回报，为8241951美元。当纽黑文公司决定将这些债券中的17,200,000美元推向市场时，J.P.摩根公司『由于他们自己的原因』、『宁愿不以他们自己的名义发行或分配这些债券』。摩根公司以92又1/2的净价拿下了这些债券；而这些债券则由基塞尔、金尼库特公司和其他公司以96又1/4的价格进行销售。

   <p>
   正如普约委员会所显示的那样，这个联盟还得到了进一步的补充。
   </p>
   <p>
   『在这些内部团体和次级团体之外，还有全国各地的银行和银行家，他们与他们合作，承销或担保销售提供给公众的证券，他们还充当这种证券的分销商。由于内部集团的成员不愿意透露他们的承销商的名字，我们不可能了解这些公司的身份，但有足够的证据表明，至少有数百家这样的公司，而且它们延伸到本国和外国的许多城市。
   </p>
   <p>
   『来自内部集团及其子集团的赞助对这些银行和银行家来说具有很大的价值，他们因此被自身利益与大的发行机构联系在一起，可以被视为这个庞大的金融组织的一部分。这种赞助给这些银行和银行家带来了不小的收入，而且没有什么风险，因为主要集团通过对大银行和信托公司的支配以及他们在国内的其他附属机构和国外的联系为证券发行提供了便利。由这个内部集团发行的证券的承销佣金通常很容易赚取，而且通常不涉及承销商对所承销证券的购买。除非他们选择购买部分证券，否则他们在交易中的利益一般会通过向他们支付佣金来调整。然而，在有些情况下，情况并非如此。这时，承销商就必须接受证券。银行家和经纪人非常渴望被允许在内部集团的领导下参与这些交易，因此，作为一项规则，当他们被邀请这样做时，不管他们对特定业务的批准情况如何，他们都会加入，以免他们拒绝后就不再被邀请。』
   </p>
   <p>
   换句话说，这些皇家银行家的邀请被解释为一种命令。结果，这些大银行家经常获得巨大的佣金，而他们自己却没有分配任何债券，也没有承担过任何实际风险。
   </p>
   <p>
   『在摩根公司及其合伙人为纽约地铁融资170,000,000美元债券的案例中，戴维森先生估计（如普约委员会报告），有100到125个这样的承销商，他们显然很乐意同意摩根公司。第一国家银行和国家城市银行应获得3%的收益（相当于5,100,000美元）以组成这个银团，从而免除自己的所有责任，而承销商则承担债券变现的风险，并被要求承担他们在未售出部分的份额。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   伪道德的保护
   </h2>
   <p>
   货币信托基金的组织是密集的，组合是全面的；但还有一个因素被认为是必要的，以使它稳定，并使其动态力量不可抗拒。专制主义，无论是金融还是政治，都是脆弱的，除非它被认为是建立在道德的认可之上。对自由的渴望是不可抗拒的。除非争取自由的努力被认为是不道德的，否则它将以抗议奴役和不作为的方式表达自己。很久以前，君主们发明了『君权神授』的虚构，作为专制主义的保护伞。银行家们模仿皇室，最近发明了所谓『道德』的宝贵规则，根据该规则，如果任何公司已经成为另一个『有信誉的』银行家的猎物，则宣布对其进行财务救助是不专业的。
   </p>
   <p>
   普约委员会说：『这些银行机构之间在购买证券方面存在竞争的可能性，通过他们与其他机构之间的谅解进一步消除，即一个机构不会通过提供更好的条件，从另一个机构那里夺走它以前服务过的客户，以及由此产生的推论，即：「如果某些银行家曾经令人满意地联合起来为一家公司发行股票，他们也应联合起来为同一公司的任何后续发行提供股票」——这被描述为银行道德的原则。』
   </p>
   <p>
   该规则的『道德』基础必须是联合起来的银行家们的利益高于社会其他人的利益。他们的态度让人想起有充足『腹地』的『势力范围』，贪婪的国家通过它来调整分歧。重要的银行业企业，由于野心太大，不愿意在联盟中处于从属地位，也由于实力太强，无法受到压制，在银行道德规则得到忠实遵守的前提下，被赋予了一个金融『势力范围』。在这些较小的势力中，最突出的是纽约的Kuhn, Loeb & Co.公司，这是一家拥有巨大财富的国际银行，拥有庞大的客户群和关系网。他们在美国铁路领域被赋予重要的『势力范围』，其中包括巴尔的摩和俄亥俄州、联合太平洋和南太平洋等系统。他们和摩根集团很少有例外地抢占了该国重要铁路的银行业务。但即使是Kuhn, Loeb & Co.也不是完全独立的。普约委员会报告说，他们是『内部集团的合格盟友』，并且通过他们『与国家城市银行和国家商业银行以及其他金融机构的密切关系』，『与摩根合伙人有许多共同的利益，与他们开展大型联合账户业务。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   由此产生的弊端
   </h2>
   <p>
   首先，这些银行家们通过各种方式向整个社会征收沉重的费用，向资金所有者索要投资许可，向铁路、公共服务和工业公司征收使用他人资金的许可，并通过这些公司向消费者征收。
   </p>
   <p>
   普若委员会说：『资本的费用理所应当是普遍进入商品和服务的价格，因此实际上是由供应者之间的协议决定的，而不是在竞争的审核制约下。如果竞争原则有任何优点，那么，在履行资本供应这样一个基本的商业职能时，任何阻止其运作的计划或安排必然是特别有害的。』
   </p>
   <p>
   第二：更为严重的却是：货币信托在直接压制竞争方面的影响。这种压制使垄断者能够榨取超额利润；但垄断在其他方面更增加了消费者的负担。垄断阻止了发展；通过阻止发展，阻止了本来会发生的生产和销售成本的降低。
   </p>
   <p>
   当摩根的合伙人在所有的无烟煤铁路中都很有影响力时，无烟煤铁路之间能存在充分的竞争吗？在类似的条件下，北太平洋铁路公司与大北方铁路公司、南方铁路公司、路易斯维尔和纳什维尔铁路公司以及大西洋海岸线公司之间，或者西屋制造公司与通用电气公司之间，还能有什么竞争可言？正如普约委员会所发现的那样：
   </p>
   <p>
   『这样的关联关系往往成为秘密安排和谅解的掩护和渠道，通过这样的银行机构来限制竞争。”』
   </p>
   <p>
   而在现有条件下，通过其他银行机构的救济是被排除的。
   </p>
   <p>
   『很难想象，这样从这个内部集团中寻求参与的银行、信托公司和其他机构可能会从事令后者不满意的业务，或者会干扰它们的计划或声望。因此，内部集团的成员所能提供的保护，构成了我们伟大工业联合体对未来竞争最安全的庇护。这些先生们强有力地控制着信贷车轮的油门，只要他们发出信号，这些车轮就会转动或停止。』
   </p>
   <p>
   第三：但比压制竞争更严重的是对工业自由的压制，实际上是对成熟工业体系本身的压制，过度的金融权力带来了这种压制。它所造成的恐吓远远超出了 『银行、信托公司和其他寻求从这个内部集团参与其有利可图的承保的机构』；也远远超出了那些直接依赖内部集团的大公司的利益。它的破坏性和麻痹性影响也延伸到了看似独立的小商人，延伸到了直接依赖『大企业』的庞大的专业人员和其他人，以及许多其他人。因为：
   </p>
   <p>
   1. 几乎每个有进取心的商人都需要银行信贷。信贷的发放涉及到银行官员的判断；经验表明，无论银行官员多么希望诚实地行使他们的自由裁量权，他们的判断会因为货币信托基金的无所不在的力量而被扭曲。公开反对巨大利益的人往往会被发现缺乏 『安全和理智』的品质，而这正是金融信贷的基础。
   </p>
   <p>
   2. 几乎每个有进取心的商人和我们的大部分专业人员都有东西要卖给或必须从大公司购买，这些大公司直接受金钱大亨的控制或影响，或从附属利益集团购买。有时是商品；有时是服务；有时他们既没有东西可买，也没有东西可卖，只是渴望政治或社会进步。有时他们只想要和平。经验表明：『与火车头作对是不健康的』，『生意就是生意』。
   </p>
   <p>
   无论在哪，你都会发现这么一个英雄：他热血沸腾，他勇往直前，他热爱男子汉的精神胜过财富、地位或安全，敢于为独立而战，并取得了胜利。同样，无论在哪，你都可能会发现殉道者，他们在沉默中抵抗，在不屈中忍受。但是，寻求『最大多数人最的大利益』的美国，不能满足于只适合英雄、烈士或奴隶的条件。
   </p>
   <h1>
   第三章：环环相扣的董事会
   </h1>
   <p>
   理事机构相互牵制的做法是许多罪恶的根源，它违反人神天道。适用于竞争对手的公司，它倾向于压制竞争和违反《谢尔曼法》。如果应用于相互交易的公司，则会导致不忠诚，并违反『一人不侍二主』的基本原则。无论是哪种情况，它都会导致效率低下；因为它消除了激励机制，破坏了正确的判断。这是不民主的，因为它拒绝了公平的环境（platform）。它是不民主的，因为它拒绝了这样的纲领：『公平的场地和不偏不倚』——用特权的拉动来代替成熟行业（manhood）的推动。它是金钱信托的最有力的工具。如果打破投资银行家对铁路、公共服务和工业公司、银行、人寿保险和信托公司的控制，就会向实现新自由迈出一大步。
   </p>
   <p>
   术语『环环相扣的董事会』（interlocking directorates）在这里被用于广泛的意义上，包括所有交织在一起的冲突利益，无论其形式如何，也无论通过什么手段实现。反对意见同样适用于公司的合同，不管是与公司的一名董事个人签订的合同，还是与他作为成员的公司签订的合同，或是与他作为官员、董事或股东而拥有利益的另一家公司签订的合同。这种反对意见也同样延伸到在两个可能相互竞争的公司中担任不一致的董事职位的人，即使这些公司实际上没有相互交易。
   </p>
   <h2>
   无尽的链条
   </h2>
   <p>
   用一个例子就能说明，现在的金融寡头如何通过运作一根无尽的链条来控制这个恶性循环的。
   </p>
   <p>
   JP摩根（或一个合伙人），纽约、纽黑文和哈特福德铁路公司的董事，使该公司向摩根公司出售一批债券。JP摩根公司从Guaranty Trust Company（摩根先生（或合伙人）是该公司的董事）借钱支付这些债券。JP摩根将债券卖给Penn Mutual人寿保险公司，摩根先生（或合伙人）是该公司的董事。纽黑文公司将债券的收益用于向美国钢铁公司购买钢轨，摩根先生（或合伙人）是该公司的董事。美国钢铁公司将钢轨的收益用于从通用电气公司购买电气用品，摩根先生（或合伙人）是该公司的董事。通用电气公司向美国电话电报公司的子公司西联电报公司出售物资；而摩根先生（或合伙人）是这两家公司的董事。电报公司与雷丁公司签订了独家电线合同，摩根先生（或合伙人）是该公司的董事。雷丁公司从普尔曼公司购买客车，摩根先生（或合伙人）是该公司的董事。普尔曼公司从鲍德温机车公司购买（供当地使用）机车，摩根先生（或合伙人）是该公司的董事。雷丁公司、通用电气公司、钢铁公司和纽黑文公司与普尔曼公司一样，从鲍德温公司购买机车。钢铁公司、电话公司、纽黑文公司、雷丁公司、普尔曼公司和鲍德温公司，像西联公司一样，从通用电气公司购买电气用品。鲍德温公司、普尔曼公司、雷丁公司、电话公司、电报公司和通用电气公司，像纽黑文公司一样，从钢铁公司购买钢铁产品。上述每家公司都通过摩根公司推销其证券；每家公司都将其资金存入摩根公司；利用每家公司的这些资金，该公司开始进一步经营。
   </p>
   <p>
   这个具体的例子在一定程度上是假设的；但它真实地代表了环环相扣的董事机构（interlocking directorates）的运作。只不过，它必须被乘以许多次，并有许多变化，才能充分代表少数人的利益交织在一起的程度。在我们的例子中，与其把纽黑文作为铁路的起点，不如选择纽约中央铁路、圣达菲铁路、南方铁路、利哈伊河谷铁路、芝加哥和大西部铁路、伊利铁路或马凯特铁路；与其把担保信托公司作为银行的蓄水池，不如选择其他十几家重要银行或信托公司中的任何一家；与其把宾州互惠银行作为债券的购买者，不如选择其他保险公司；与其把通用电气作为其合格竞争者，不如选择西屋电气和制造公司。这个链条确实是无穷无尽的；因为每个被控制的公司都与许多其他公司纠缠在一起。
   </p>
   <p>
   作为 "大企业 "的核心，钢铁公司当然是出类拔萃的。斯坦利委员会表明，控制钢铁公司的几个人，本身就是重要铁路的所有者，也是其他29个铁路系统的董事，拥有12.6万英里的线路（超过美国铁路里程的一半），以及重要的蒸汽船公司。通过所有这些联盟和它所控制的巨大运输量，钢铁公司的影响遍及铁路和汽船公司，这些铁路和汽船公司不仅仅作为承运人，而且作为钢铁的最大客户。它对钢铁用户的影响还远不止如此。这几个人也是12个使用钢铁的街道铁路系统的董事，包括一些世界上最大的铁路。他们是40家机械和类似的用钢制造公司的董事；是许多天然气、石油和自来水公司的董事，这些公司是钢铁相关产品的广泛用户；也是使用电线的大型电话和电报公司的董事。这些不同公司的总资产超过160亿美元，这些少数人通过这些公司对美国的商业施加影响。
   </p>
   <p>
   显然，在恢复美国企业的自由之前，必须有效地禁止联锁董事机构以及该术语所暗示的一切。这种禁止不会是一种创新。它只是对道德和人性的基本法则给予充分的法律认可：『一人不事二君』（No man can serve two masters）。令人惊讶的是，在处理公司问题时，如此根深蒂固的公平原则竟然被偏离了。因为在其他方面，没有什么法律规则比禁止受托人占据不一致的位置、禁止与自己打交道、禁止利用受托人的地位谋取私利的规则更严格地适用。一个公司的董事显然是一个受托人，就像在非公司协会或私人信托财产中担任类似职务的人一样，他们被专门称为受托人。法院已经充分认识到这一点。
   </p>
   <p>
   因此，纽约上诉法院在一个重要案件中宣布：
   </p>
   <p>
   『虽然在技术上不是受托人，因为公司财产的所有权在公司本身，但他们被赋予了受托人的职责并承担了受托人的责任。他们拥有控制公司财产和管理公司事务的权力，不受限制或阻碍，对第三方而言，他们是公司的代理人；但对公司本身而言，公平地认为他们应承担受托人的责任。虽然法院通常将董事视为代理人，但衡平法院（译注：courts of equity——英美法系的司法系统针对英美法的不足，发展出一系列法律原则，实现更好形式的司法公正，也译作『公义法』或『平衡法』）将他们视为受托人，并要求他们对任何违反信托关系的行为承担严格责任。出于所有的实际目的，当被要求对他们的官方行为负责时，他们是受托人。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   废除法律
   </h2>
   <p>
   但是，这条明确规定的、有益于商业的规则实际上被法院取消了，因为法院设立了两个不幸的限制，无疑是对所谓的商业需求的让步。
   </p>
   <p>
   首先，法院认为：在一个公司和一个董事之间，或者在两个有共同董事的公司之间的合同是有效的，只要证明在签订合同时，公司是由独立的董事代表的，有利害关系的董事的投票是不必要的，他的出席不需要构成法定人数。
   </p>
   <p>
   第二：法院认为，即使一个普通的董事积极参与了两个公司之间的合同制定，该合同也不是绝对无效的，而只是在公司的选择下才会无效。
   </p>
   <p>
   第一种限制忽视了法律规则，即受益人有权从所有受托人那里获得无私的建议，而不仅仅是某些建议；受托人可以通过不作为以及行动来违反其信托。它还忽视了人性的规律，认为董事的影响只限于投票行为。每个人都知道，最有效的工作是在进行任何投票之前完成的，巧妙地，没有可证明的参与。每个人都应该知道，否认少数人在董事会中的代表权已经导致大多数公司被一两个人所支配，并且实际上禁止了对主导力量的所有批评。即使在董事会没有被支配的情况下，董事之间也经常存在着『和谐的合作』，以确保每个人都能从公司的利益中获得应有的份额。
   </p>
   <p>
   第二种限制是，有利益关系的董事积极参与制定的合同被认为是可撤销的，而不是绝对无效的，这无视了经验的教导。认为这种合同仅仅是无效的结果，实际上就是宣布它们有效。控制公司行动的是董事；没有什么理由期望董事会与其他董事签订的任何合同，无论多么不公平，随后都会被撤销。从醉酒的菲利普到清醒的菲利普的上诉并不经常发生，也不是很有成效。但在这里，我们甚至缺乏一个上诉方。董事和占主导地位的股东当然不会上诉；而小股东很少了解事实，而这是有效上诉所必需的，无论是向董事、全体股东，还是向法院提出上诉。此外，个别股东试图干预现有管理层所带来的财务负担和风险，通常是令人望而却步的。因此，除非是在董事会成员发生重大变化之后，否则很少有人提起撤销与董事的合同的诉讼。而董事会成员的激进变化是很少的。事实上，普约委员会报告说：
   </p>
   <p>
   『没有一个证人（主要的美国银行家作证）能够说出国家历史上股东成功地推翻任何大公司现有管理层的例子。股东们似乎也没有成功地确保对公司现有的管理层进行调查，以确定它是否得到了良好或诚实的管理。』
   </p>
   <p>
   马克斯 · 帕姆（Max Pam）先生在1913年4月的《哈佛法律评论》中提议，政府应向少数股东提供援助。他敦促要求每个公司的总裁每年向股东以及州和联邦官员报告公司签订的、任何董事都有利益的每一份合同；美国或州的总检察长应调查这些合同，并采取适当的程序，将所有这些合同搁置，并追回任何损失；或者在不取消合同的情况下，从有利益关系的董事那里追回从中获得的利润。为此，还指示州和国家银行检查员、州保险监督员和州际商业委员会检查每家银行、信托公司、保险公司、铁路公司和其他每家从事州际商业的公司的记录。帕姆（Pam）先生关于联锁董事机构的观点值得仔细研究。作为与信托组织关系密切的律师，他多年来有充分的机会权衡『大生意』的利弊。他坚信『环环相扣的董事会』是对公众的威胁，需要严厉的立法，这非常重要。在支持他提出的具体措施方面可以说很多。但为了达到效果，补救措施必须既基本、又全面。
   </p>
   <h2>
   保护的要点
   </h2>
   <p>
   对少数股东的保护要求绝对禁止公司签订董事拥有私人利益的合同，并宣布所有此类合同不仅是可撤销的，而且是绝对无效的。
   </p>
   <p>
   在铁路和公共服务公司的情况下（与私营工业公司不同），这种禁止也是为了公众的利益而要求的。因为利益交错会滋生低效和不忠；而公众却要承受更高的费用和更糟的服务，为贪污和低效付出很大代价。事实上，在知道公司的总收入是否得到适当的使用之前，无法确定费用高低。因为当一个公司的重要合同是通过双方都有利益关系的董事签订时，通常的推定是所花的钱已经被适当地使用了，这种推定并不成立。这在铁路运输中尤其如此，因为公司在自己的领域中经常缺乏有效的竞争。
   </p>
   <p>
   但是，禁止联锁董事会（即『环环相扣的董事们』）令人信服的理由既不是保护股东，也不是保护公众免受低效和贪污的影响。确凿的证据（如果可以得到的话）表明，联锁董事会的做法对所有股东有利，是最有效的组织形式，但这并不能消除反对意见。因为比效率更重要的是工业和政治自由；而这些都受到金钱信托的威胁。必须禁止『联锁董事会』，因为如果不结束这种大型公司的做法，就不可能打破货币托拉斯（Money Trust，译注：可理解为『货币垄断』）。
   </p>
   <h2>
   作为公共服务企业的银行
   </h2>
   <p>
   由于银行的性质和功能，『联锁董事会』的做法在适用于银行时是特别令人反感的。银行存款是我们货币体系的一个重要组成部分。它们几乎和我们的铁路一样，是商业中的一个基本因素。法律不应该把接受存款和发放贷款视为私人业务，而应该视为公共服务之一。认识到这一点，法律已经在许多方面对其进行了规范。银行的职能是接收存款和发放贷款。它并不比普通运输公司更有权专门利用其权力来建立或摧毁其他企业。就借款人而言，贷款的发放与否应完全由利率和所涉及的风险决定；而不是由偏袒或其他与银行职能无关的考虑因素决定。人们可以放心地把自己的钱借给（或不借给）他们认为合适的人，不管他们的动机是什么。但是，银行资源主要不是由股东或董事拥有的。在摩根合伙人拥有主要影响力的34家银行机构中，近四分之三的资源总量是由存款构成的。商业和工业对银行存款的依赖，作为快速资本的共同储备，是如此的彻底，以至于存款银行业务应被确认为『影响公共利益』的业务之一。禁止公共服务型企业进行不公正的歧视、或给予不适当优惠的一般规则，应适用于此类银行的业务。
   </p>
   <p>
   银行和货币委员会主席欧文参议员最近说。
   </p>
   <p>
   『我自己的判断是：银行是一个公共事业机构，不能被视为私人事务，原因很简单，在政府的保障下，公众被邀请把钱存入银行，而公众有权通过有组织的当局来保障其利益。这其中的逻辑是无法逃避的。美国的所有银行，不管是公共的还是私人的，都应该被视为公共事业机构，它们在那里接受公众存款。』
   </p>
   <p>
   当然，银行机构的董事和官员必须在发放或拒绝贷款方面被赋予广泛的自由裁量权。但这种自由裁量权的行使，不仅要诚实地影响到股东，而且要公正地影响到公众。『对股东的质朴诚实』要求董事考虑的利益是所有股东的利益，而不是他们中碰巧成为董事的那部分人的利益。但是，作为公众的受托人，总体福利要求董事履行更严格的职责。贷款的发放涉及到对自由裁量权的微妙行使，这一事实使得我们很难确定每个公共服务企业所应遵守的平等待遇规则是否得到了履行。但这一困难只是强调了下面这种困难：将『存款银行不得提供任何贷款或参与任何董事拥有私人利益的交易』这一规则绝对化。我们应该牢记这一点。如果私人拥有的银行不能履行向借款人提供平等机会的公共职责，就会出现对政府拥有银行的需求，这将是不可抗拒的。
   </p>
   <p>
   美国最高法院霍姆斯法官在俄克拉荷马银行案中的陈述很有意义：
   </p>
   <p>
   『我们不能说我们所提到的公共利益和其他利益不足以保证国家将整个银行业务置于其控制之下。相反，我们认为，除了在它可能规定的条件下，它可以从管制到禁止。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   官方先例
   </h2>
   <p>
   『银行不得提供董事拥有私人利益的贷款』——这项要求不会给银行董事带来困难或限制。它可能会使银行董事处置他的一些投资并避免进行其他投资；但经常发生的情况是，担任一种职务的人不能担任另一种职务，或迫使他处置某些经济利益。
   </p>
   <p>
   法官被剥夺了在任何他有最小经济利益的案件中出庭的资格；大多数法官，为了能在法庭上自由行事，一上任就着手处理这样的投资，即：那些『所有可能使他们对可能出现在他们面前的任何问题的判断产生偏差的投资』。州际商业专员被禁止拥有受委员会管辖的任何公司的任何债券或股票。联邦政府的任何行政官员与任何他直接或间接拥有金钱利益的公司进行政府业务往来，是一项严重的刑事犯罪。
   </p>
   <p>
   而我们伟大的银行机构的董事，作为银行信贷的最终法官，今天行使的职能对国家福利的重要性并不亚于我们法院的法官、州际商业专员和部门负责人的职能。
   </p>
   <h2>
   禁令的范围
   </h2>
   <p>
   在关于这一问题的立法建议中，提出了四个重要问题：
   </p>
   <p>
   1. 禁止在潜在的竞争性公司中设立联锁董事职位的原则是否应适用于州立银行机构以及国家银行？
   </p>
   <p>
   2. 是否应适用于所有类型的公司，还是只适用于银行机构？
   </p>
   <p>
   3. 『禁止公司进行管理层有私人利益交易』的原则应适用于董事和高管，还是仅适用于高管？
   </p>
   <p>
   4. 该原则是否应适用于禁止与另一家公司进行交易，而该公司的一名董事仅作为股东拥有利益？
   </p>
   <h1>
   第四章：只为一个主人服务
   </h1>
   <p>
   普约委员会已经清楚地介绍了有关货币信托基金的事实，以至于结论似乎不可避免。他们的诊断揭示了强烈的金融垄断、及实现金融垄断的手段。合并（combination），亦或『利益的交织』（the intertwining of interests）被证明是当前体系中普遍存在的弊端。为了解放工业，委员会建议制定21项具体的补救规定。这些措施中的大多数都是针对证据所揭示的一些弊端而制定的，如果所有这些措施都被采纳，那么普约委员会的立法无疑会减轻目前的痛苦，并有助于遏制疾病的蔓延。但许多建议的补救措施都只在局部治标，如果不去治本，那就不可能治愈。事实上，有必要进行一次大手术。委员会对这一建议犹豫不决；尽管所需的基本治疗很简单——『只为一个主人服务』。
   </p>
   <p>
   当然，人们充分认识到互设董事会的弊端；但在这方面提出的禁令仅限于一个非常狭窄的范围内。
   </p>
   <p>
   首先。委员会认识到，可能相互竞争的公司不应该有一个共同的董事；但它将这一禁令限制在国家银行的董事身上，并说：
   </p>
   <p>
   『国家银行的官员或董事不得担任任何其他银行、或任何信托公司、或其他金融或其他公司、或机构的官员或董事，无论这些公司或机构是否根据州或联邦法律组织，它们被授权接受存款或从事抵押贷款、或买卖证券的业务，但本节规定的除外；任何人不得担任任何国家银行的官员或董事，如果他是私人银行家或从事接受存款业务的银行家公司或伙伴关系的成员。但该银行、信托公司、金融机构、银行家或银行家公司的所在地或业务所在地与该国家银行的所在地或业务所在地在同一城市、城镇或村庄。还规定，国家银行的董事或该董事的合伙人可以是不超过一家根据该国家银行从事业务的州的法律组织、并在同一地点开展业务的信托公司的官员或董事。』
   </p>
   <p>
   第二：委员会承认，公司不应订立管理层之一拥有私人利益的合同；但它一方面将这一禁令限制在国家银行，另一方面也仅限制在官员身上。它是这么规定的：
   </p>
   <p>
   『任何国家银行不得借出或垫付资金或信贷，购买或贴现任何带有其官员（或其官员直接或间接为成员）的任何合伙企业，或其官员拥有（或实际拥有）10%以上股本的任何公司的签名或背书的期票、汇票、汇票或其他债务证明。或向任何此类官员或任何此类合伙企业或公司、为其或代表其借出或预付资金或信贷，或从任何此类官员（或此类官员为其成员）、或在其中拥有财务利益的任何合伙企业或公司购买任何证券，如本文所述，或在进行此类交易时其任何职位为官员的任何公司。 』
   </p>
   <p>
   禁止如此限制的交织关系，无论如何以其他条款作为补充，都不会结束金融垄断。『货币托拉斯』（Money Trust）这条巨蟒最多只会被平息，而不会被扼杀。『禁止在潜在的竞争公司中担任共同董事的规定』应该适用于州立银行和信托公司，也适用于国家银行；它应该像适用于银行机构一样完全适用于铁路和工业公司。禁止管理层之一拥有私人利益的公司合同应适用于董事和官员，也应适用于州立银行、信托公司以及其他类别的公司，也应适用于国家银行。而且，正如下文所示，这种广泛的立法属于国会的权力范围。
   </p>
   <p>
   让我们进一步研究这个问题：
   </p>
   <h2>
   禁止在潜在的竞争性公司中共用董事
   </h2>
   <p>
   1.国家银行。普约委员会清楚地表明了对适用于银行机构的共同董事的反对意见。
   </p>
   <p>
   『作为实施补救措施的第一步，也是最重要的一步，而且在我们看来是决定性的原因，独立于这一考虑，我们建议废除和禁止在潜在竞争的金融机构中设立联锁董事职位，只要国会有能力实现这一结果……当我们发现，在一些情况下，同一个人在一些银行或信托公司中担任董事，这些银行和信托公司都位于同一个城市的同一个区域，从事同一类业务，并有类似的伙伴，隶属于同一个集团，代表同一类利益，所有进一步的竞争借口都是无用的…… 如果允许服务于同一领域的银行拥有共同的董事，真正的竞争将变得不可能。此外，这种做法给这些共同董事带来了不公平的优势，即了解各家银行借款人的情况，从而为压迫提供了无尽的机会。』
   </p>
   <p>
   这一建议符合其他国家的立法或惯例。英格兰银行、法国银行、比利时国家银行和苏格兰的主要银行都把在其他银行担任董事的人排除在其董事会之外。根据法律规定，俄罗斯不允许任何人在一家以上的银行管理委员会任职。
   </p>
   <p>
   委员会的建议也与马萨诸塞州联邦在若干年以前颁布的、旨在通过储蓄银行遏制金融垄断的法律相一致。在马萨诸塞州的巨大财富中，很大一部分是储蓄银行的存款。这些存款分布在194家不同的银行，位于131个不同的城市和城镇。这194家银行不仅在形式上、而且在事实上都是独立的和不同的。为了使银行不被少数金融家控制，马萨诸塞州的法律规定：任何储蓄银行的执行官或受托人（董事）不能在任何其他储蓄银行担任任何职务。这条法规于1876年通过。几年前，这项规定被作了一些补充：储蓄银行的高层管理者不能在任何国家银行担任类似的职务。马萨诸塞州试图以此来遏制个人金融家的权力；而且看不出有什么弊端。当该法案通过时，其储蓄银行的存款总额为243,340,642美元；存款账户数为739,289；人口中每人的平均存款为144美元。1912年11月1日，存款总额为838,635,097.85美元；存款账户数为2,200,917；每个账户的平均存款为381.04美元。马萨诸塞州表明，遏制少数人的权力，至少在这方面，和效率还有全体人民的繁荣完全一致。
   </p>
   <p>
   2.州立银行和信托公司。禁止银行机构的共同董事的理由同样适用于国家银行和州立银行，包括那些本质上是银行的信托公司。在纽约市有37家信托公司，其中只有15家是清算所的成员；但这15家公司在1912年11月2日的总资源为827,875,653美元。事实上，拥有205,000,000美元资源的银行家信托公司和拥有232,000,000美元资源的担保信托公司是货币信托公司最有用的工具之一。全国没有一家银行的存款比后者多；只有一家银行的存款比前者多。如果在州立银行或此类信托公司中允许共同担任董事，那么主要的国家银行的章程无疑将很快被交出；这些机构将通过根据州法律重新注册来逃避联邦控制。
   </p>
   <p>
   普约委员会没有严格执行禁止在潜在的竞争性银行机构中担任共同董事的规定，甚至对国家银行也没有严格执行。它允许同一个人在一家国家银行和一家在同一地点开展业务的信托公司担任董事。拟议的让步为严重的危险打开了大门。首先，该条款将允许任何国家银行不是只与一家信托公司联锁，而是与该银行有多少董事就有多少家信托公司联锁。因为根据普约法案（Pujo bill），没有人可以成为在一个以上的信托公司担任董事的国家银行董事，但没有任何东西可以阻止一家银行的每个董事成为不同信托公司的董事。纽约国家商业银行有一个由38名董事组成的董事会。在纽约市有37家信托公司。38名董事中的37名可能会成为不同的纽约信托公司的董事：因此，37家信托公司将与国家商业银行相互牵制，除非普约委员会将『董事人数限制为13人』的这类建议也被采纳。
   </p>
   <p>
   但是，即使该法案被修正，以便将一家银行可能的联锁限制在一家信托公司内，这一让步的明智性仍然是值得怀疑的。诚如Pujo委员会所言，信托公司『可能从事的业务』与国家银行『适合从事的业务』这两者的性质不同。但是，至少在东方国家，信托公司实际开展的业务是非常相似的；这两类银行机构有这些重要的共同点：每一家都是存款银行，每一家都用其存款进行贷款。私人银行家也可以从事一些与银行适当开展的业务不同的业务；但根据委员会法案的条款，从事接受存款业务的私人银行家将被禁止担任国家银行的董事；这种禁止的理由同样适用于信托公司和私人银行家。
   </p>
   <p>
   3.其他公司。银行机构的联锁只是发展货币信托的因素之一。其他公司的联锁也是一个同样重要的因素。而且，禁止联锁董事的规定应该扩展到任何类别的潜在竞争公司，例如：人寿保险公司、铁路和工业公司以及银行机构。普约委员会表明，乔治 · F · 贝克先生是六家铁路公司的共同董事，这六家铁路公司运输了80%的无烟煤市场，并拥有88%的无烟煤矿产。摩根合伙人是北太平洋铁路公司和大北方铁路公司、南方铁路公司、路易斯维尔和纳什维尔铁路公司、以及大西洋海岸线等所谓竞争性铁路之间的纽带，以及西屋电气和制造公司、以及通用电气等部分竞争性工业企业之间的纽带。如果要打破货币托拉斯，必须切断所有潜在的大型竞争公司之间的联系。
   </p>
   <h2>
   禁止管理层有私人利益的公司合同
   </h2>
   <p>
   在普约委员会的建议中，『禁止与管理层发生私人利益的公司合同』这项原则只适用于国家银行，而且只适用于官员。所有其他公司都被允许继续这种做法；甚至在国家银行中，董事也可以自由地拥有相互冲突的私人利益，但他们不得因促进银行资金的贷款而接受报酬，也不得参与其银行作为承销商或所有者或贷款人可能感兴趣的证券的联合体、促销或承销。董事在其中有利益关系的所有贷款或其他交易应以他自己的名义进行；只有在充分通知共同董事后才可授权；并且这些事实应在公司的记录中公布。
   </p>
   <p>
   货币托拉斯（Money Trust）不会受到仅限于官员的禁令的干扰。根据这种性质的法律，财务控制权将继续由少数人行使，而不会受到实质性的损害；但这种权力将通过某种不同的渠道发挥出来。银行官员是由董事任命的，而且那些银行官员通常是董事会的顺民。作为银行官员的个人，现在是金融垄断的重要因素，无疑会辞去官员的职务，而仅仅成为董事。官员的工资损失很容易得到补偿。JP摩根公司的任何成员都不是13家银行机构的官员，这些机构的总资源为12.83亿美元，他们作为董事通过这些机构开展了大量业务。仅限于官员的禁令不会影响摩根在这些银行机构的业务。如果银行董事会中有少数人的代表（这也是普约委员会明智的主张），这样的规定可能会通过少数董事的警惕性来为股东提供一些保护，防止占主导地位的董事利用其权力损害少数股东的利益。但即使如此，该条款也不能保护公众；货币托拉斯立法的主要目的不是为了防止董事伤害股东，而是为了防止他们通过对银行的交织控制使公众利益受损。任何仅限于官员的禁令都不会实质性地改变这一状况。
   </p>
   <p>
   即使只适用于所有银行和信托公司，禁止联锁董事的规定实际上会迫使摩根代表从与他们有联系的13家银行机构的董事中辞职，或从所有与这些银行和信托公司有业务往来的铁路、快递、汽船、公共事业、制造业和其他公司的董事中辞职。无论他们从这一类公司还是另一类公司辞职，这个无尽的链条都会被打成许多碎片。而无论他们是否退休，摩根的权力显然会大大减少：因为如果他们不退休，他们的业务范围就会大大缩小。
   </p>
   <h2>
   将私人利益禁令应用于所有类型的公司
   </h2>
   <p>
   货币信托（Money Trust）的建立是由于投资银行家对铁路、公共服务、工业和人寿保险公司的侵占，以及他们对银行和信托公司的控制造成的。在货币信托被打破之前，所有这些关系必须被切断。除非这几类公司中的每一个都被阻止与他们自己的董事、以及与这些董事有利益关系的公司进行交易，否则它们就无法被切断。比如说。JP摩根最有力的单一权力来源是162,500,000美元的存款，包括78家州际铁路、公共服务和工业公司的存款，摩根公司可以随意使用这些存款。拟议的禁令即使适用于所有银行机构，也不会直接影响到摩根权力的这一巨大来源。然而，如果禁令包括铁路、公共服务和工业公司以及银行机构，那么摩根公司的成员将很快从所有董事会中退休。
   </p>
   <h2>
   将私人利益禁令应用于持股利益
   </h2>
   <p>
   禁止一家公司与另一家公司进行交易，而该公司的一名董事也在其中拥有利益，即使他在第二家公司的利益仅仅是股东的利益，这项禁令也应适用。如果一名董事只是第二家公司的股东，那么他的利益冲突可能和『他同时是一名董事』一样严重。
   </p>
   <p>
   普约委员会所采集的证据中，有一个令人讨厌的小规模垄断，即纽约证券交易所授予美国银行票据公司的独家特权。最近发行的60,000,000美元的纽约市政债券被拒绝在交易所上市，因为该市拒绝接受美国公司征收的55,800美元的债券雕刻费，而纽约银行票据公司可以用44,500美元的价格同样完成这项工作。为了解释这种非同寻常的垄断，有资料显示，金融界的知名人士都是美国公司的股东。其中最大的股东是摩根先生，他有6,000股。摩根公司的任何成员都不是美国公司的董事，但他们以某种方式施加了足够多的影响，使美国公司获得了证券交易所的垄断权。
   </p>
   <p>
   普约委员会虽然没有建议禁止董事拥有私人利益的交易，但承认超过一定规模的股东利益可能和直接的个人利益一样，是一种有力的影响工具；因为它建议：
   </p>
   <p>
   『任何公司直接或间接向其（银行）董事所持股票超过10%的银行借款，只有在通知其共同董事、并在授权该贷款的会议记录中详细说明该交易的情况下，才被允许。』
   </p>
   <p>
   如上所述，关于通知的特别规定没有为公众提供任何保护；但如果它有，其适用范围应扩大到较小的持股量。事实上，很难确定一个低到经济利益不会影响行动的限额。当然，单一董事的持股利益，远远小于10%，可能是最有效的利诱。摩根先生在美国银行票据公司的持股比例仅为3%。JP摩根公司在国家城市银行的600万美元投资只占该银行股票的6%；即使没有『他儿子被选入董事会』这点作为补充，这无疑也是有效的。
   </p>
   <h2>
   特别取消资格
   </h2>
   <p>
   斯坦利委员会在对钢铁托拉斯（Steel Trust）进行调查后得出结论：联锁董事制度的弊端非常严重，应绝对禁止主要依赖铁路的某些行业代表担任铁路董事、高管或雇员。因此，它建议取消任何从事制造或销售铁路、车辆、机车、铁轨或钢筋的人，或从事煤炭开采和销售者，担任铁路董事、高管或雇员的资格。斯坦利法案的激烈程度表明，人们多么希望消除目前的弊端并减少货币托拉斯（Money Trust）的权力。
   </p>
   <p>
   银行机构的董事、高管和雇员应通过类似的规定，取消其担任人寿保险公司董事、高管或雇员的资格。阿姆斯特朗的调查表明，1905年，人寿保险公司是金融垄断的最有力的因素。他们的权力主要通过银行和信托公司行使，而银行和信托公司被他们的股权和巨额存款所控制。阿姆斯特朗的立法要求寿险公司出售其股票。Mutual Life和Equitable两家公司部分地执行了，但是，摩根公司的合伙人买下了这些股票。现在，不是人寿保险公司控制银行和信托公司，而是后者和银行家控制人寿保险公司。
   </p>
   <h2>
   禁令如何被限制
   </h2>
   <p>
   除非所有類別的公司都被納入禁止董事相互勾結和禁止管理層有私人利益的公司進行交易的範圍內，否則货币托拉斯不会被破坏。但这并不意味着禁令必须适用于每一类、每一家公司。某些例外情况与『仅仅保护公众免受货币托拉斯的影响』是完全一致的；尽管对少数股东的保护和商业道德要求禁止公司签订董事拥有私人财务利益合同的规则应普遍适用。1912年12月31日，美国的公司数量为305,336家。其中只有1,610家公司的资本超过500万美元。很少有资本低于500万美元的公司（银行除外）能够通过它们自己的业务或它们的附属机构对一般的信贷条件产生明显的影响。因此，注册资本少于500万美元的公司（银行除外）目前可以被排除在法规的范围之外。该禁令也可以被限制，以使其不适用于任何只做州内业务的工业企业，无论其资本和资源的数量如何；因为实际上所有的大型工业企业都从事州际贸易。这将排除一些没有被排除在该法实施范围之外的零售企业和当地工人及制造商。同样，位于居民人数少于10万人城市的银行和信托公司，如果被认为是明智的，目前可以排除在外，如果它们的资本金少于50万美元，它们的资源少于250万美元的话。在较大的城市，即使是较小的银行机构也应受法律约束。这种例外应能克服任何可能提出的反对意见，即在一些较小的城市，禁止联锁董事会将使社区内所有有能力的商人因害怕失去在银行工作的机会而被排除在银行董事会之外。
   </p>
   <p>
   也应该有一个例外，以便允许公司和其适当的子公司之间互设董事职位。当然，禁止管理层有私人利益的交易不应适用于铁路和公共服务公司为整个社区不加区分地提供服务的合同，或为所有客户提供的共同服务，如银行为其储户提供的普通服务，明示或暗示的合同。
   </p>
   <h2>
   国会的权力
   </h2>
   <p>
   人们可能会问：国会是否有权对国家银行以外的任何企业的行为施加这些限制？如果国会的权力受到如此限制，占主导地位的金融家难道不会在这种法律颁布后，将他们的国家银行转变为州立银行或信托公司，从而摆脱国会的控制？
   </p>
   <p>
   这两个问题的答案都很清楚。国会有充分的权力对几乎所有的公司，包括州立银行、信托公司和人寿保险公司实施这种禁令；而且可以使其无法逃避。虽然国会没有被授予直接管理州立银行、信托或人寿保险公司、或铁路等公共服务公司的权力，但除州与州的商业之外，它可以通过控制邮件特权或通过征税权间接地这样做。
   </p>
   <p>
   实际上，在美国没有任何业务可以在不使用邮件的情况下进行；国会可以根据其合理的自由裁量权，拒绝任何在国会认为有损于公共福利的条件下进行的业务使用邮件。因此，国会无权直接压制彩票，但它通过在重罚下拒绝彩票企业使用邮件，间接压制了彩票。国会没有权力直接镇压商业欺诈，但它不断通过发布拒绝使用邮件特权的欺诈令间接地镇压商业欺诈。国会没有直接权力要求报纸公布其经营者名单和发行量，也没有权力要求报纸将付费内容明确标为广告，但它通过拒绝所有不遵守规定要求的出版物的二等邮件特权，对新闻界进行了监管。
   </p>
   <p>
   出于同样的目的，国会恢复了征税权。国会无权管制火柴的生产或油精的使用；但它却通过对火柴征收重税，抑制了白磷火柴的生产，并大大减少了油精的使用。国会无权禁止（或直接管理）各州银行发行的银行票据，但它通过对各州银行发行的任何银行票据征收10%的税，间接禁止了它们的发行。
   </p>
   <p>
   国会对州际商业的权力也得到了类似的利用。国会通常不能为雇员的事故提供赔偿，也不能直接承诺禁止卖淫，但作为管理州与州之间商业的一个附带条件，它颁布了《铁路雇主责任法》（Railroad Employers' Liability law）和《白奴法》（ White Slave Law）。它对商业工具有充分的权力，如电报和电话。
   </p>
   <p>
   由于这种对国会权力的行使至少在半个世纪前就已很普遍，所以国会现在应该毫不犹豫地在迫切需要的地方使用这种权力。因为全面禁止联锁董事机构是我们实现新自由的一个基本条件。这样的法律将涉及到主要银行和银行家与其他企业关系的巨大变化。但是，货币信托立法的目的正是为了实现巨变。除非它这样做，否则金融寡头们的权力无法被打破。
   </p>
   <p>
   但是，虽然制定这样的法律对于解放商业是非常重要的，但它不会完全恢复工业自由，它必须得到其他补救措施的补充。
   </p>
   <h1>
   第五章：宣传能做什么
   </h1>
   <p>
   『宣传』作为社会和工业疾病的补救措施受到了公正的赞扬。据说，阳光是最好的消毒剂，电灯是最有效的警察。而宣传在反对金钱托拉斯（Money Trust）的斗争中已经发挥了重要作用。普约委员会在披露有关金融集中的事实时，为实现新自由做出了最重要的贡献。战场已经被勘察和描绘出来。敌对势力已经被定位、计算和评估。这是迈向救济的第一步，而且是漫长的一步。委员会法案中有关证券交易所的成立以及与证券上市有关的声明的规定无疑会产生有益的影响。但是，应该进一步呼吁宣传方面的服务。在即将到来的斗争中，必须以多种方式利用这种强大的力量，作为一种持续的补救措施。
   </p>
   <h2>
   财富
   </h2>
   <p>
   合并和控制别人的钱和别人的生意。这些是金钱信托发展的主要因素。但投资银行家的财富也是一个因素。而且随着近年来他的财富的超常增长，财富作为金融集中的一个因素的相对重要性也在不断地增加。正是财富使摩根先生在1910年以300万美元购买了面值5.1万美元的平等人寿保险协会的股票。他从这项投资中获得的直接收入被法律限制在每年不到八分之一的水平；但这使他合法地控制了504,000,000美元的资产。正是这些财富使摩根的合伙人能够从公平保险公司和互助人寿保险公司购买几家银行机构的股票，这些股票合并到银行家信托公司和担保信托公司，使他们控制了3.57亿美元的存款。正是这些财富使摩根先生获得了他在第一国民银行和国家城市银行的股份，价值21,000,000美元，通过这些股份他巩固了与这些机构的三重联盟。
   </p>
   <p>
   现在，这些巨大的财富是如何积累的？其中一些是自然累积的。有些是由于明智地利用了特殊的投资机会。有些是由于银行家们的巨大业务范围。然后，权力滋生财富，如同财富滋生权力。但是，这些巨额财富的一个主要原因是那些控制资本和投资者渠道的人收取的巨额费用。他们收取的过路费简直就是 "交通所能承受的一切”。
   </p>
   <h2>
   那些银行家们过高的佣金
   </h2>
   <p>
   遗憾的是，由于时间不够，普约委员会无法向国家提交有关投资银行家作为发起人费用、承销佣金和利润所占金额的证据。没有什么能比一张显示近年来征收的这些税款总额的表格更清楚地表明银行家所行使的权力。现在，仅仅为了收集这些数据而重启货币信托基金的调查是非常值得的。但早期的调查已经披露了一些有启发性的事实，虽然是零星的。
   </p>
   <p>
   推广钢铁信托的辛迪加，作为几周工作的报酬，获得了62,500,000美元的现金证券；其中，J.P.摩根公司作为辛迪加经理的服务获得了12,500,000美元，此外，他们作为辛迪加的认购者，在剩余的50,000,000美元中也有份额。摩根辛迪加为推广管子信托基金从总发行量为80,000,000美元的股票（优先股和普通股）中获得20,000,000美元的普通股。庞大的佣金也不限于信托的推广。最近，银行家联合体在许多情况下，除了得到一笔可观的现金外，还因出售资本重组后的工业企业的优先股而得到所有发行的普通股的三分之一。对于出售成熟的制造业公司的优先股，通常会收取现金佣金（或利润），占所筹现金的7.5%至10%。对于高级工业企业的债券，银行家的佣金（或利润）从5％到10％是很常见的。
   </p>
   <p>
   这些沉重的费用也不仅仅局限于工业企业。甚至连据称是高等级的铁路证券也受到了类似的负担。在纽黑文的信用还没有受到损害的时候，J.P.摩根公司购买了纽黑文担保的纽约、威彻斯特和波士顿铁路公司的第一抵押债券，价格为92 1/2；它们以96 1/4的价格销售。他们以约88的价格购买了由缅因州中央铁路公司担保的波特兰终点站公司的债券，这些债券以92的价格销售。
   </p>
   <p>
   这些承销佣金的很大一部分是由大的银行机构拿走的，不是因为他们销售债券的服务，也不是因为承担风险，而是因为确保其他人销售债券和承担风险。因此，当Interboro铁路公司（一家最繁荣的公司）为其最近发行的1.7亿美元的债券融资时，J.P.摩根公司获得了3%的佣金，即5,100,000美元，实际上是为了安排其他人承销和销售债券。
   </p>
   <p>
   主要银行机构所获得的佣金或利润总额只能是猜测，因为它们的交易总额没有被披露，而且佣金或利润率差别很大。但普约委员会已经提供了一些与该问题有关的有趣数据。仅计算州际公司的证券发行，J.P.摩根公司在1902-1912年期间单独或与他人一起直接促成了19.5亿美元的公共销售。我们不知道J.P.摩根公司的平均佣金或利润是多少；但我们知道，这个数字的每一个百分点都会产生19,500,000美元。然而，即使是这个19.5亿美元的巨大总额也只包括支付了佣金或利润的部分证券。它不包括任何国内公司发行的证券，不包括任何私人销售的证券，也不包括任何政府、州或市政债券。
   </p>
   <p>
   投资银行家的财富在很大程度上是由于像这样的征收。由于这种财富是货币信托公司行使权力的一个重要因素，我们必须努力结束这种不正当的财富获取，以及不正当的组合。货币信托基金是如此强大和牢固，如果我们想获得新的自由，必须有效地阻止其不正当权力的每一个来源。
   </p>
   <h2>
   如何制止过度的收费？
   </h2>
   <p>
   普约委员会建议，作为对这种过度收费的补救措施，禁止州际公司签订任何协议，建立一个唯一的财政代理来处理他们的证券发行；州际铁路的证券发行应置于州际商业委员会的监督之下；他们的证券应只在公开或私人竞争性投标的情况下进行处理，或根据委员会规定的条例进行处理，该委员会具有充分的调查权力，将发现和惩罚妨碍投标竞争的联合行为。一些州的公共服务委员会现在行使这种权力；将这种权力赋予州际委员会可能是明智的，尽管哈德利铁路证券委员会的建议是相反的。但是普约委员会提议的官方监管将仅限于铁路公司，而在纽约证券交易所上市的其他公司的新证券发行量在过去五年中累计达4,525,404,025美元，这比铁路或市政发行量都要多。然而，宣传提供了另一种甚至更有希望的补救措施：一种管理银行家收费的方法，它将自动适用于铁路、公共服务和工业公司。
   </p>
   <p>
   可以问这样一个问题。为什么这些过高的费用会被接受？首先承担资本费用的公司，无疑是因为银行家的控制；直接通过联锁董事机构或类似的关系，以及间接通过银行家之间的联合来压制竞争。但是，为什么投资者会屈服，因为所有这些费用最终都是由投资者承担的，除非公司成功地将负担转嫁给社会，但真的会这样么？在所有证券购买者中占绝大多数的小额投资者，完全不受银行家的控制。他们的屈服无疑部分是由于这样一个事实，即银行家控制着获得公认的安全投资的途径，几乎与他们控制资本的途径一样充分。但是，投资者的奴性也有一部分是由于他对事实的无知。如果每个投资者都知道，他们从银行家那里购买的证券在多大程度上被过度承销、被收取过高佣金、以及所引起的利润的过度稀释，那么就有可能出现资本对这些不公正的索取行为的罢工，这不是很有可能吗？
   </p>
   <h2>
   资本的罢工
   </h2>
   <p>
   英国最近的一次经验支持这一观点。在去年春天的一个短暂时期内，伦敦市场上的银团发行了九种不同的产品，总额为135,840,000美元，而这些贷款中平均只有约10%被公众接受。资金『很紧张』，但提供的利率非常宽松，没有人怀疑投资者的资金供应充足。
   </p>
   <p>
   『投资者对新贷款的一长串回绝，在罗斯柴尔德大规模发行证券的失败中达到了高潮。它将在许多天内成为金融讨论的话题，城市中的许多人都表示，它可能对目前的贷款发行和承销制度产生革命性的影响。正在讨论的问题是，公众已经不愿意认购他们认为承销商有能力以低于发行价的价格出售的股票，因为他们收到了佣金，而且证券交易所已经开始意识到公众的态度。在公众看来，承销商与其说是保证贷款被认购以换取其佣金，不如说是一个中间人，他有机会以低于公众的价格获得股票，以便他随后可以将其转手获利。他们宁愿不认购，也要等待机会来分享这一利润。他们觉得，如果在发行这些股票时，以更有吸引力的价格向他们提供股票，就不需要向承销商支付那么高的佣金了。这是对中间人存在的另一种实际抗议，即使是间接的抗议，这种抗议是当今金融的特点之一。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   作为补救措施的公开性
   </h2>
   <p>
   迫使银行家在发行证券时公开他们所获得的佣金或利润。让每一封通函、招股说明书或债券或股票的广告都清楚地显示银行家从他的中间人服务中得到了什么，以及债券和股票为发行公司带来了什么。这是现有的证券持有人和潜在的购买者都有权利知道的。如果银行家的报酬是合理的，考虑到所涉及的技能和风险，就不能反对将其公开。如果不合理，投资者就会『罢工』，就像投资者最近在英国所做的那样。
   </p>
   <p>
   要求披露银行家的佣金或利润还有一个原因：它将帮助投资者判断投资的安全性。在证券营销中，有两类风险。一类是银行家（或公司）是否能按发行价为债券或股票找到现成的购买者的风险；另一类是投资者是否能得到一个好东西。证券的制造者和银行家的主要兴趣是让它以发行价出售。投资者的兴趣主要是买到好东西。小投资者几乎完全依赖银行家对证券质量的了解和判断；正是这一点使他与银行家的关系成为一种信任。但目前，投资银行家所处的位置与这种关系不一致。当然，银行家的报酬应该根据他所承担的风险而变化。如果债券或股票不能按发行价迅速售出的风险很大，那么承销佣金（即保险费）应该相应地大一些。但银行家不应该因为让投资者承担更大的风险而得到更多的报酬。在实践中，银行家因承销较弱的证券而获得较高的佣金，理由是他自己的风险更大。证券越弱，银行家就越有动力促使他的客户为他提供服务。现在，法律不应承诺（除了与铁路和公共服务公司有关的情况下）确定银行家的利润。它也不应该试图阻止投资者做糟糕的交易。但是，现在人们认识到，在最简单的商品销售中，应该有充分的信息披露。古老的caveat emptoris原则正在消失。法律已经开始要求公开以帮助公平交易。《联邦纯净食品法》并不保证质量或价格；但它通过要求披露成分来帮助买方判断质量。在确定证券的实际价值时，需要了解的最重要的事实之一是它所含的水的数量。而为推销证券而支付给银行家的任何过高金额都是水。要求向投资者全面披露所支付的佣金和利润的数额；不仅投资者会提高警惕，而且银行家的报酬也会自动调整到公平合理的程度。『过高的佣金』将在很大程度上停止，因为这是一种不公正的财富获取方式。
   </p>
   <h2>
   真正的披露
   </h2>
   <p>
   但这种披露必须是真实的，而且，它必须是对投资者的披露。仅仅要求向公司专员或其他联邦和州的官员提交一份事实声明是不够的。这几乎是无效的，就像《纯净食品法》（Pure Food Law）要求制造商仅仅向该部门提交一份成分声明，而不是仅仅要求用标签去说明问题。如果按照普约委员会法案的规定，向证券交易所提交一份完整的声明，也是不充分的。
   </p>
   <p>
   为了有效，必须让投资者真正了解事实，最好的办法是要求在每份邀请投资者购买的通知、通告、信件和广告中以良好的大字体说明这些事实。对这一要求的遵守也应该是强制性的，而不是投资者可以放弃的东西。因为整个公众都对结束银行家的索取行为感兴趣。多年前，英国曾承诺保护其投资者免受发起人的欺骗，要求进行类似的披露；但英国的法案在很大程度上未能达到其目的，部分原因是根据该法案，事实声明只提交给政府官员，部分原因是投资者可以放弃这一规定。而英国的法规现在已经在后一个方面进行了修改。
   </p>
   <h2>
   披露辛迪加的细节
   </h2>
   <p>
   所要求的公示还应该包括披露承销中的所有参与者。承销的一个常见情况是，在一定时期内，任何一个银团成员都不得以低于银团的价格出售，除非银团提前解散。换句话说，银行家们通过协议，制定了一个人为的价格。根据《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》（Sherman Anti-Trust Law），该协议通常可能是非法的。然而，这种价格维持并不一定是令人反感的。如果事实被公之于众，它可能完全符合一般的福利。但披露应包括承销商名单，以使公众不会被误导。投资者应该知道他的顾问是否没有利益关系。
   </p>
   <p>
   不久前，一家领先的银行机构的成员承诺为他的公司（一家制造企业）最受欢迎的优先股收取浮动佣金提供理由。银行家们为他们的服务收取了25万美元的现金，以及三分之一的普通股，金额约为200万美元。他说：『当然，如果我们能把它全部留给自己，这就太多了；但我们不能。我们不得不分出一大部分。有57个参与者。为什么，我们甚至不得不把一万美元的股票给了他（『他』指的是业务所在城市的一家主要银行的行长）。有一天，他可能会被问及他对这支股票的看法。如果他耸耸肩，说他不知道，我们可能会因为这支股票而失去许多客户。我们不得不给他一万美元的股票，以教他不要耸肩。』

   我们今天已经获得了对伊利诺伊州___________ ____________的成功的机械业务的实质性控制，该公司已经以Excelsior制造公司的名义成立，资本为1000万美元，其中500万美元是优先股，500万美元是普通股。
   </p>
   <p>
   由于我们有一大批信任的客户，我们能够从业主那里获得推销优先股的协议。我们将确定一个价格，业主将获得每股95美元的现金。
   </p>
   <p>
   我们以每股100.75美元的价格向你们提供这支优秀的股票。我们自己的佣金或利润将只有每股5美元多一点，或者说25万美元的现金，此外还有150万美元的普通股，这是我们收到的奖金。这笔现金和股票佣金我们将按不同的比例与承销团的下列参与者进行分配：
   </p>
   <p>
   C. D. & Co., 纽约
   </p>
   <p>
   E. F. & Co., 波士顿
   </p>
   <p>
   L. M. & Co., 费城
   </p>
   <p>
   I. K. & Co., 纽约
   </p>
   <p>
   O. P. & Co., 芝加哥
   </p>
   <p>
   如果这样的通知很普遍，投资银行家就会 "不虚此行"，因为通常情况下，他们只会得到合理的报酬。
   </p>
   <p>
   对于优先股的营销，如上面提到的Excelsior制造公司的案例，投资银行家无疑是必不可少的，作为中间人他们提供了有用的服务。但他们利用自己的强势地位，收取了过高的费用。然而，在很多情况下，银行家的服务是可以完全免除的；如果有可能，就应该取消他，这不仅是为了经济，而且是为了打破金融集中。
   </p>
   <h1>
   第六章：明明不需要银行家的地方
   </h1>
   <p>
   联锁董事制度的废除将通过结束许多不正当的联合而大大削弱银行家的权力。关于银行家的佣金、利润和合伙人的宣传将提供有效的帮助，特别是通过遏制不正当的索取。普约委员会建议的许多具体措施（其中一些涉及技术细节）将大大有助于纠正公司和银行的滥用行为；并因此有助于阻止金融集中。但是，投资银行家在其合法范围内获得了广泛的控制权，甚至在其业务正常进行的地方也威胁到了公共福利。如果要实现新自由，就必须利用一切适当的手段来减少这种权力。一个简单而有效的补救措施近在眼前，即使没有新的立法，也可以广泛适用。这就是消除中介般的银行家们，因为他们是多余的。
   </p>
   <p>
   今天，几乎所有的政府、州和市都为所有出售的债券向银行家支付通行费。他们为什么要这样做？这不是因为总是需要银行家，而是因为银行家控制着债券和股票投资者通常可以接触到的唯一途径。银行家已经成为普遍的税收收集者。诚然，他向我们的州和市政府征收的税款比例低于他向公司征收的税款比例。但是，很少有州或城市能在其提供的每笔贷款中逃脱向银行家支付一些这样的税。即使新发行的债券是以公开拍卖的方式出售的，或者是以密封投标的方式出售给出价最高的人，银行家集团通常也会获得大量的债券，然后以可观的利润出售给人民。即使没有必要存在，但中间人只要存在，就一定会为他自己收取贡品。
   </p>
   <p>
   与其他商人一样，国家和市政债券的经销商也有合法的领域。已经拥有这种债券的投资者必须有一个媒介，他们可以通过这个媒介出售他们所持有的债券。而那些在投资者中缺乏良好声誉的州或市（或必须寻求更远的市场的州或市）需要银行家来分销新发行的债券。但是，有许多州和城市已经建立了良好的声誉，并有一个家族市场在手。这些州和城市应该直接向投资者出售他们的债券，而不需要中间人的干预。由于一些公司的情况类似，它们的债券和股票也应该直接出售给投资者。金融效率和工业自由都要求在可能的情况下，废除银行家的收费。
   </p>
   <h2>
   银行家和经纪人
   </h2>
   <p>
   投资银行的业务绝不能与债券和股票经纪人的业务相混淆。两者经常结合在一起；但两者的功能本质上是不同的。经纪人所提供的服务非常有限。他与证券的最初发行和它们进入市场都没有关系。他只是根据具体的指令，作为另一个人的代理人谈判购买或出售。他不行使任何自由裁量权，除了在召集买方和卖方或执行订单的方法上。对于他卑微的服务，他得到适度的报酬，即佣金，通常是百分之一的八分之一。(每100美元有12.5美分)，按所售证券的面值计算。投资银行也是一个单纯的中间人。但他是一个委托人，而不是一个代理人。他也是一个债券和股票的商人。在许多情况下，他在交易中获得的报酬被描述为『利润』更准确，而不应该称为『佣金』。就新发行的政府、州和市政债券而言，尤其如此，他作为商人，以自己的名义购买和销售证券；通常以批发方式从制造商那里购买，以零售方式卖给投资者；承担商人的风险和商人的利润。在购买公司证券时，利润往往非常大；但即使是大的利润也可能是完全适当的；因为当银行家的服务被需要并被适当地执行时，它们是非常有价值的。在购买政府、州和市的证券时，利润通常较小；但如果没有必要，即使是非常小的利润也是不合理的。
   </p>
   <h2>
   银行家如何提供服务
   </h2>
   <p>
   银行家的服务有三种不同的功能，而且只有这三种：
   </p>
   <p>
   第一：作为特别专家。投行具有普通零售商的责任，只销售同类产品中好的商品。但他在这方面的责任异常沉重，因为他所经营的商品，绝大多数客户自己都无法在没有帮助的情况下做出明智的判断。投资者购买大多数公司证券的行为比赌博好不了多少，因为他没有得到像银行家那样对证券进行过彻底调查的人的建议。因为很少有投资者有时间、工具或能力来适当调查公司证券的价值。
   </p>
   <p>
   第二：作为特别分销商。银行家在为证券提供渠道方面提供了一项非常重要的服务。他的关系使他能够迅速接触到可能的买家。投行的商誉（即拥有老客户的信任）使他们能够在企业可能完全找不到市场的地方实现销售。
   </p>
   <p>
   第三：作为特别零售商。投行像其他商人一样，在交易中携带他的股票，直到它可以被销售。在这一点上，他所提供的服务对企业来说往往是非常有价值的。需要的现金可以立即得到，因为整个证券的发行可以通过一次交易来处理。即使没有立即付款，在需要时提供资金的知识也往往是最重要的。通过持有库存证券，银行家还为投资者提供了一项服务，他们因此能够在他们希望的时间购买证券。
   </p>
   <p>
   每当证券制造者或投资者需要这三种服务中的全部或任何一种时，就需要投资银行家，向他支付报酬是适当的。如果没有这种需要，银行家显然是多余的。就我们许多国家和市政债券以及一些公司证券的原始发行而言，不存在这种需要。
   </p>
   <h2>
   银行家不发挥作用的地方
   </h2>
   <p>
   不需要银行家的价值专家来告诉我们，那些马萨诸塞州或纽约、波士顿、费城或巴尔的摩以及几十个较小的美国城市的债券是安全的投资。有关此类债券的基本财务事实是许多美国投资者的常识；当然，也是居住在有问题的特定州或城市的大多数可能投资者的常识。在金融事实不为人所知的地方，它们是如此简单，以至于它们可以被任何潜在的投资者轻易地总结和理解，而无需专家的解释。在购买证券之前，银行家们经常雇用自己的会计师来核实企业提供的报表，并使用这些会计师的证明作为销售的辅助手段。国家和市政当局，即证券的制造者，可以出于同样的目的，雇用具有较高声誉的独立公共会计师，他们将提供他们的证书，用于推销证券。投资者也可以在没有银行的帮助下得到保证，基本的法律条件是健全的。银行家们在购买某期证券之前，通常会从自己的律师那里获得关于其合法性的意见，并邀请投资者进行审查。如果各州和市镇当局能以具有公认专业地位的独立律师的意见来补充其法律代表的意见，并证明发行的合法性，这将达到同样的目的。
   </p>
   <p>
   也不需要投资银行家来寻找愿意小批量购买纽约或马萨诸塞州、波士顿、费城或巴尔的摩或其他一百个美国城市新发行债券的投资者。一个寻求直接向投资者推销自己债券的州或市，在开始时自然会遇到一些推销大额债券的困难。而在一个较新的社区，在那里没什么新的、可供募集的资本，可能无法为任何大额发行找到买家。投资者往往是保守的，而且他们已经被训练成认为银行家的干预是必要的。银行家们自然会阻止各州和各城市免除其服务的任何尝试。进入一个迄今为止被他们垄断的市场，通常要经过一番努力。但是，由银行家资助的投资者以及其他投资者可以及时认识到避免中间商并直接与负责任的借款人打交道的好处。政府，像私人企业一样，将不得不做教育工作；但这种宣传将比银行家所做的成本低得多，而且更有成效。许多投资者已经对银行家的索取行为感到不耐烦；并渴望直接与他们更有信心的政府机构进行交易。而且，在银行家无法引起兴趣的小投资者中，可以立即开发出巨大的需求，他们现在从不购买国家或市政债券。这个新领域的开放将提供一个市场，在某些方面比银行家现在接触到的市场更理想，当然也更广泛。
   </p>
   <p>
   州或市政当局通常也不需要投资银行家的服务，以携带他们的债券等待分配给投资者。如果立即需要大量资金，州或市政当局（至少是老社区）应该能够临时筹集资金，就像银行家现在所做的那样，同时等待将他们的债券分配给投资者。银行家用别人的钱而不是用自己的钱来发行债券。为什么城市不能临时使用别人的钱呢？银行家优先使用银行里的存款，往往是因为他们控制了银行。把这些机构从银行家的控制下解放出来，没有哪个申请者会比我们的大城市更喜欢借人民的钱。波士顿拥有1,500,000,000美元的评估价值和78,033,128美元的净债务，它的风险甚至不亚于Lee, Higginson & Co.或Kidder, Peabody & Co.两家公司。
   </p>
   <p>
   但通常情况下，城市在任何时候都不需要或不应该需要大笔资金。除了不时需要偿还到期的贷款，或从私人业主手中接管一些现有的公共设施外，不会出现这种对大笔资金的需求。为任何其他目的而发行的大量债券通常是为了满足未来的需要，而不是为了满足当前的需要。现代有效的公共财政，通过用系列债券代替长期发行的债券（在马萨诸塞州，这已经成为一种义务），到时候将不再需要大量的资金来支付到期的债务，因为每年的到期债务将由当年的税收支付。购买现有公用事业工厂的情况很少发生，而且在购买之前往往要进行长时间的谈判。当它们发生时，如果有先见之明，通常可以在不一次性支付全部现金的情况下进行融资。
   </p>
   <p>
   今天，当大量发行债券时，银行家表面上向城市支付自己的钱，实际上是向城市支付他从银行借来的其他人的钱。然后，银行通过城市的存款，拿回了大部分的钱。而当这些钱被送回银行时，银行家就有机会再次借钱用于其他业务。这个过程给城市带来了双重损失。城市的损失是没有从银行获得投资者会支付的那么多债券。然后，它又损失了在需要之前筹集的资金的利息。因为银行家从城市收到的债券利息很少低于4%；而收益被存入银行，银行很少允许每日余额超过2%的利息。
   </p>
   <h2>
   那些自助的城市
   </h2>
   <p>
   在今年，一些城市在必要的情况下进行了自救。债券市场很差。商业不稳定，资金紧张，普通投资者不愿意。银行家们不愿意接受新的债券发行。市政当局不愿意支付对他们要求的高利率。许多城市被法律或法令禁止支付超过4%的利息；而好的市政债券则以4.5%到5%的价格出售。但是，必须筹集资金，并尝试直接向贷款人而不是向银行家之类的中间人借款。以这种方式筹集资金的城市包括费城、巴尔的摩、圣保罗和纽约州中部城市的尤蒂卡。
   </p>
   <p>
   费城在市长布兰肯伯格的激励下，在大约两天内以4%的价格卖出了近417.5万美元，此后又进行了一次『场外』销售。在巴尔的摩，在《太阳报》的协助下，在场外（over the counter，指不在交易所交易）以4.5%的比例销售了476.6万美元。尤蒂卡的两次4.5%的债券『流行销售』基本上都被『超额认购』。此后，其他大大小小的城市都进行了 场外债券销售。尤蒂卡的经验证明这具有普遍意义，正如其审计官弗雷德 · G · 鲁斯维格所说：
   </p>
   <p>
   『今年6月，我刊登广告出售两期债券，一期为10万美元，另一期为1.9万美元，利率为4.5%。后者被一个当地竞标者按面值购买，前者我们购买了1万美元作为我们的偿债基金。剩下9万美元没有出售，没有人出价，这是我第一次无法出售我们的债券。大约在这个时候，巴尔的摩和费城的「大众销售」引起了我的注意。这些城市的现行法律没有像国家层面的法律那样对官员进行限制，我无法复制他们的方法。我意识到，这附近有很多钱，如果我能够设计一个符合国家层面法律的计划，使销售对小投资者有吸引力，无疑会取得成功。我发现，在以前的努力中，为了引起小市民的兴趣，他们不理解溢价的含义，宁愿不买也不愿出价高于面值。他们也反对在出价时交纳保证金。在安排「大众销售」时，我在报纸上宣布，虽然我必须将作品授予出价最高的人，但我认为平价出价将是最高出价。我还宣布，我们将发行面额低至100美元的债券，除非出价达到或超过5000美元，否则我们不要求交纳保证金。然后，我成功地让当地报纸刊登了关于市政债券的社论和当地通知，特别是关于尤蒂卡的债券和即将进行的销售。潜在的购买者所要做的就是填写所需的金额，签上自己的名字，在标书上盖章，然后等待开标的日子。我并没有收到很多小额竞标者的竞标，第一次拍卖时只有一个人出价100美元，第二次拍卖时有一个人出价100美元，想要500美元以下的人不超过十个。大多数竞标者希望得到1,000至5,000美元，但几乎所有的人都是经济能力相对较弱的人，对一些人来说，投资代表了他们的全部积蓄。在授予债券时，我优先考虑了尤蒂卡的居民，我在以令人满意的方式分配各种期限的债券方面没有任何困难。』
   </p>
   <p>
   『我相信每个城市都有大量的人愿意购买自己的债券，如果法律能使这种方式变得更容易。锡拉丘兹和邻近的伊里昂村都无法以通常的方式进行销售，它们向我寻求程序方案，此后都按照类似的方式进行了成功销售。通过这种方式，我们能够将债券的利率保持在4.5%，而那些按照旧计划依靠债券公司的城市则不得不将利率提高到5%。我赞成修改法律，使市议会在预算和分摊委员会的批准下，可以确定出售债券的价格，而不是要求竞标。然后在审计官办公室将债券出售给任何愿意支付该价格的人。每次发行的价格应根据不同期限的不同价值来划分等级。根据我们目前的法律，条件太复杂了，除非在平价投标的基础上，否则销售是不可行的。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   圣保罗市的试验
   </h2>
   <p>
   圣保罗市在它的实验中明智地引入了一个更加民主的特点，克利夫兰的伟大市长汤姆 · L · 约翰逊想到了这一点（但没有利用），他的朋友W · B · 科尔弗，现在是《每日新闻》的主编，提请圣保罗的官员注意。约翰逊市长已经认识到接触人民的小额储蓄的重要性；并得出结论，不仅有必要以非常小的面额发行债券，而且要使它们可以按面值赎回。他试图将债券投资与储蓄银行的特权实际结合起来。市政债券通常只能以大面额发行，例如1,000美元，这是一个需要克服的障碍。约翰逊市长的计划是：让偿债基金委员拿着大块的债券，针对它们发行10美元面额的证书，并让委员们同意（根据他们购买证券的权力）按面值和利息买回这些证书。他坚持认为，储蓄银行的经验表明，赎回功能不会被证明是一个难题；因为希望提取资金的人的比例很小；而且存款几乎总是远远超过提取的金额。
   </p>
   <p>
   圣保罗的偿债基金委员（sinking fund commissioners）和市政代表奥尼尔（City Attorney O'Neill ）批准了约翰逊的计划；在高利率的情况下，7月份按4%的比例出售了净额为502,300美元的证书；8月份出售了147,000美元；9月份出售了超过150,000美元，平均每天净销售额约为5,700美元。科尔弗先生在报告圣保罗的经验时说：
   </p>
   <p>
   『大约有2,000名个人购买者，平均存款约350或360美元。没有向银行出售证书。在第一个月里，存款的平均数要高得多，原因是：在很多情况下，那些拥有相当长时间积累的储蓄的人，从邮政储蓄银行、正规银行、各种藏匿处提取了他们的钱，并将它们存入了城市。现在，这些人每个月都会来一到两次，存入十美元或二十美元，因此，在9月份，个人存款的平均数下降得非常快，而且各种迹象表明，随着时间的推移，小额存款的数量将继续增加，而相对较大的存款则变得更少。』
   </p>
   <p>
   『事实上，这些证书存款是稳定的，远比那些观察有利的再投资和相当自由地转移资金的富人的存款和投资要多。除非遇到大灾大难，否则拥有三四百美元储蓄的人几乎不会动用这笔资金（译者注：当时300-400美元相比于正常人的生活费是一笔很大的钱）。我们相信，这里每天的存款，日复一日，将继续照顾到所有的提款，并仍然为一天留下净收益，目前这个净数字约为每天5700美元。』
   </p>
   <p>
   许多城市现在被阻止直接向小投资者出售债券，因为有法律迫使债券必须以大面额发行，或者要求将发行的债券提供给最高出价者。这些立法限制应该被迅速取消。
   </p>
   <h2>
   销售技巧和教育
   </h2>
   <p>
   已经取得的这种成功在很大程度上是由于领先的进步报纸所做的无偿教育工作。但是，要做的教育工作决不能局限于教育『民众』（即债券的购买者）。市政官员和立法者也有相当多的东西需要学习。首先，他们必须学习销售技巧。向人民推销债券是一门新的艺术，而这门新的艺术仍然没有得到发展，比如一些一般的问题还没有被解决。除了这些所有州和城市共有的问题，几乎每个社区都会有必须解决的地方问题和必须克服的地方困难。即使是一般问题的适当解决也要花费相当长的时间。必须进行许多试验；毫无疑问，也会有许多失败。每一个伟大的商品经销商都知道他在获得成功之前必须克服的障碍；以及在开辟和准备市场方面必须投入的大量资金。个别企业在宣传方面花费了数百万美元；最终在赢得市场后收获了巨大的利润。城市必须从这些伟大的经销商那里吸取教训。城市必须准备好研究这些问题，并为适当的宣传工作审慎地花费。最后，如果能确保债券的直接市场，甚至在必要时允许在特定的问题上采用比银行家要求的更高的利率，这可能会证明是一种经济。未来的业务将产生巨大的经济效益。获得一个城市债券的直接市场越来越重要，因为随着市政功能的不断扩大，贷款也必须大量增加。1898年，新发行的市政债券总额为103,084,793美元；1912年为380,810,287美元。
   </p>
   <h2>
   储蓄银行作为客户
   </h2>
   <p>
   在纽约、马萨诸塞和其他16个州，只要有一个纯粹的互助储蓄银行系统，稍加组织，就有可能为债券的直接购买者开发一个重要的市场。马萨诸塞州各市镇发行的债券最近平均每年约为15,000,000美元，而该州的债券约为3,000,000美元。马萨诸塞州的194家储蓄银行，总资产为902,105,755.94美元，在1912年10月31日持有90,536,581.32美元的州和市的债券和票据。其中约60,000,000美元投资于马萨诸塞州城镇的债券和票据，约8,000,000美元投资于州政府的问题。储蓄银行的存款正以每年超过30,000,000美元的速度增长。马萨诸塞州和市政债券在几年内，在持有人手中发行的债券是免税的，而其他类别的债券通常由储蓄银行持有，须缴纳市场价值0.5％的税。因此，马萨诸塞州的储蓄银行将越来越多地选择马萨诸塞州的市政工程作为高等级债券投资。当然，在联邦的合作下，马萨诸塞州的城市和城镇可以很容易地与储蓄银行一起开发一个『场外』债券业务的『家庭市场』（home market）。而其他州的储蓄银行也为他们的市政当局提供了类似的机会。
   </p>
   <h2>
   合作
   </h2>
   <p>
   银行家们通过组合获得了他们的权力，可为什么城市和州不应该通过合作的方式将自己从银行家那里解放出来呢？因为通过城市和州之间的合作，可以大大促进市政债券的直接销售。
   </p>
   <p>
   马萨诸塞州有33个城市，每个城市的人口超过12,000人；71个城镇，每个城镇的人口超过5,000人；250个城镇，每个城镇的人口少于5,000人。这些城市中，有38个城市现在有未偿还的资金债务。净债务总额约为180,000,000美元。每年马萨诸塞州的城市和城镇都会发行约15,000,000美元的债券和票据，以满足新的要求和偿还旧的债务。如果这些城市能合作销售证券，每个城市的债券市场将被拓宽；同时也会存在一个马萨诸塞州市政证券的共同市场，通常会有很好的供应，会得到适当的宣传并会吸引投资者。成功的商品销售显然需要携带足够的、种类齐全的库存。如果每个城市都单独行动，努力直接推销其债券，城市的债券销售活动必然是零星的。它向投资者供货的能力将受到其自身对资金需求的限制。市场也将局限于特定城市的债券。但是，如果一个州和它的城市应该合作，就可以开发出一个持续的、广泛的场外债券销售市场。三百多个城市的联合销售机构，如马萨诸塞州，自然会有各种债券和票据的持续供应，只要投资者想买，就可以买到少量的。建立这样一个联合销售机构将是一个简单的事情，各城市在国家的适当监管和援助下，将通过该机构进行合作。
   </p>
   <p>
   城市之间的合作和与州政府的合作可以在另一个重要方面发挥作用。这354个马萨诸塞州的城市在总体上拥有大量的银行余额。有时一个城市的余额代表了未用的收入；有时是未用的贷款收益。对于这些余额，他们通常从银行获得2%的利息。市政当局的余额就像其他储户的余额一样，各不相同；一个城市有闲置资金，而另一个城市则有需求。为什么所有这些城市和乡镇不合作？比如，让国家成为他们共同的银行家，并且像农民和工人通过信用社合作一样相互提供资金，这样，各城市就可以各取所需，而不是余额躺在账面上去吃那2%的利息。
   </p>
   <p>
   马萨诸塞州联邦目前在其偿债基金和其他基金中持有近3,000万美元的马萨诸塞州市政证券，占这些基金中所有证券的近四分之三。它每年的购买总额接近400万美元。它直接从城市和乡镇购买的资金今年已经超过了100万美元。如上所述，在市政债券销售机构和信贷联盟中进行合作，只是国家职能的一个简单延伸。这将是国家和市政融资效率的一个明显进步；更重要的是，这将是朝着民众从银行家的控制下解放出来的漫长一步。
   </p>
   <h2>
   企业自救
   </h2>
   <p>
   在当地或全国范围内具有良好声誉的强大公司，可以用类似的方式从银行家那里解放出来。我们一些主要城市的公共服务企业可以很容易地为它们的债券建立场外市场；而且，现在一些州立委员会对这些企业的证券发行进行监督，这将大大有助于实现这一目标。这样，这些公司不仅可以摆脱银行家的控制和征收，而且可以赢得宝贵的地方支持，投资者的资金会得到更多照顾。在经济和政治方面，智慧和牢靠在于直接向民众发出呼吁。
   </p>
   <p>
   宾夕法尼亚州铁路公司现在主要依靠其股东获得新的资本。但是，一个拥有长期持续成功和稳定声誉的公司应该有更广泛的财政支持，应该完全消除银行家。宾夕法尼亚州铁路公司在其系统中拥有2,700个车站，只需花费一点钱，就可以创造出几乎同样多的渠道，通过这些渠道获得资金，以满足其不断增长的需求。
   </p>
   <h2>
   银行家的保护
   </h2>
   <p>
   有人可能会说，声誉往往比证明它们的条件要长，过期的声誉对投资者来说是陷阱；需要投资银行家来保护他免受这种危险。没错；但大银行家或他们的小附属机构什么时候保护过人们免受这种陷阱的伤害？
   </p>
   <p>
   曾经有哪条铁路比纽黑文铁路的银行家更多？是否有比新英格兰更多的银行家领导的投资者群体？在这个伟大的系统倒下的六年前，人们向这些银行家专家指出了隐藏的危险。腐烂的木头已经提供了证据。那些滋生灾难的政策被暴露无遗。银行家们没有采取任何行动。此后，银行家们一再被要求注意结构的持续恶化。纽黑文的账目显示，有11,481名股东是马萨诸塞州的居民；5,682名股东在康涅狄格州；735名在罗德岛州；3510名在纽约州。在纽黑文的股东中，有10,474人是女性。在纽黑文的股票持有者中，有10,222人经济条件很差，他们持有的股票只有1至10股。投资者们非常需要保护。城市目录显示，波士顿有146家银行，普罗维登斯有26家，纽黑文和哈特福德有33家，纽约市有357家。但是，在最近州际商业委员会的调查之前的漫长岁月里，有谁与这些新英格兰和纽约的银行家有联系，对这一巨大的信托财产的持续管理不善提出了抗议，或警告公众即将发生的灾难？一些银行家卖掉了他们自己持有的股票。一些银行家向一些受宠的客户低声建议出售纽黑文股票。但没有一个银行家加入到那些试图让新英格兰地区的人们看到即将到来的灾难并通过及时的措施来避免灾难的行列。新英格兰的主要银行准备与纽黑文管理层『合作』，为推销无尽的新证券收取丰厚的佣金；但他们没有采取任何措施来保护投资者。这些银行家是盲目的吗？还是他们害怕反对JP摩根公司的意愿？
   </p>
   <p>
   也许，最需要新自由的是银行家。

   第七章：大人物和小生意
   </h1>
   <p>
   J. P.摩根公司在给普约委员会的信中称：『实际上这个国家的所有铁路和工业的发展，最初都是通过大银行这样的中介机构进行的。』 这种说法在事实上是完全没有根据的。相反，几乎所有这些对我们的舒适和繁荣的贡献都是在没有他们的帮助下『开始的』。大银行家与这些企业发生联系，要么是在获得成功之后，要么是在证明了成功的可能性之后进行『重组』，但那些冒着全部风险的、坚韧的先驱者的资金已经用完。
   </p>
   <p>
   我们早期的铁轨和街区铁路、汽车、电报、电话、无线电、天然气、石油、收割机械、钢铁工业；纺织、造纸和制鞋工业、以及几乎所有其他重要的制造业分支都是如此。这些企业中的每一个都可以被恰当地描述为『伟大的交易』。那些为它们的引入提供必要财政援助和商业管理的人，有权与发明家一样，分享我们对所取得的成就的感激。但是，这种企业最初的融资是由大大小小的投资银行家承担的例子极为罕见。它通常由一些习惯于承担风险的普通商人完成，或者是由发明家、或先驱们的一些富裕朋友完成的，他们在很大程度上并非是为了赚钱。你会发现银行家提供了援助，但通常也是一家小型的地方银行机构，而不是一个『大银行』帮助『启动』了这项事业。
   </p>
   <h2>
   铁路
   </h2>
   <p>
   我们已经将大银行家与铁路联系起来。但在东部铁路的早期历史中，他们的作用并不明显；而在中西部，经验在某种程度上是类似的。
   </p>
   <p>
   波士顿和缅因州铁路公司拥有并租赁了2,215英里的线路；但它是由大约166家独立的铁路公司组成的。纽黑文铁路公司拥有并租赁了1,996英里的线路；但它是由112家独立的铁路公司组成的。修建这些小公路的必要资金是通过州、县或市的援助聚集起来的；部分来自商人或土地所有者，他们试图推进自己的特殊利益；部分来自投资者；部分来自那些富有的、热心公益的人，他们希望促进特定社区的福利。在这些铁路中的第一条建成约75年后，JP摩根公司通过创建纽黑文 · 波士顿和缅因州的垄断公司，成为所有这些铁路的财政代理人。

   我们蒸汽船航线的历史也是如此。1807年，罗伯特 · 富尔顿在法官和政治家（不是银行家）罗伯特 · R · 利文斯顿的资助下，用克莱蒙特号证明了可以用蒸汽推动船航行。1833年，哈利法克斯的库纳德三兄弟和其他232人（魁北克和哈利法克斯蒸汽航运公司的股东）共同出资约8万美元建造了皇家威廉号，这是第一艘横跨大西洋的蒸汽船。1902年，在个人企业几乎开发了所有伟大的远洋航线多年之后，JP摩根公司以其52,744,000美元的四分之一债券（现在售价约为60美元）和100,000,000美元的股票（优先股和普通股）成立了国际商业海运公司，该公司从未支付过股息。就在第一条跨大西洋蒸汽船的正规航线『库纳德号』成立的62年后，摩根先生组织了航运信托。

   电报
   </h2>
   <p>
   电报机的故事也是如此。用于莫尔斯（Morse）发明的资金是由他的合作伙伴和同事阿尔弗雷德 · 维尔（Alfred Vail）提供的。最初的线路（从华盛顿到巴尔的摩）是由国会在1843年拨款30,000美元建成的。66年后，摩根公司通过资助美国电话电报公司的收购，成为西部联盟的银行家。
   </p>
   <h2>
   收割机
   </h2>
   <p>
   仅次于铁路和蒸汽船，收割机可能是在推动美国发展中最给力的因素。收割机中最重要的是赛勒斯 · H · 麦考密克（Cyrus H. McCormick）的收割机。这使得谷物收成有可能增加二十或三十倍。在引进这位伟大的商人的发明时，没有任何投资银行家参与。
   </p>
   <p>
   麦考密克没有钱；但威廉 · 巴特勒 · 奥格登，一位铁路建设者，同时也是前市长以及芝加哥的主要公民，提供了25,000美元，1847年在那里建立了第一家工厂。55年后，JP摩根完成了兼并了五大收割机公司，并获得了300万美元的佣金。当时，这些公司合并为国际收割机公司，股本为120,000,000美元，尽管它们拥有巨大的资产和盈利能力，但之前的资本总额仅为10,500,000美元。这有力地证明在之前的所有年份里，没有投资银行家为它们提供资金。事实上，麦考密克在商业方面和机械发明方面一样能干。在奥格登向他支付25,000美元购买企业的一半权益两年后，麦考密克以50,000美元的价格将其买回；此后，直到他1884年去世，除了麦考密克家族成员，没有人对该企业有任何兴趣。

   银行家时代
   </h2>
   <p>
   也许有人会说，在资本积累到出现银行家之前、或者在那些大银行成立之前，铁路、蒸汽船、电报以及收割机等行业就都已被引进了，因此，询问银行家在后来的工业发展中提供了哪些服务会更公平些。JP摩根公司（J. P. Morgan & Co.）已有55年历史；库恩勒布公司（Kuhn, Loeb & Co.）已有56年历史；李希金森公司（Lee, Higginson & Co.）已有50多年历史；基德、皮博迪公司（Kidder, Peabody & Co.）已有48年历史；但投资银行家在过去半个世纪的重大改进中的作用似乎与早期银行家一样小。
   </p>
   <h2>
   钢铁
   </h2>
   <p>
   美国的现代钢铁工业已有45年历史。伟大的银行家没有参与启动它。安德鲁 · 卡内基，当时已经是一个有能力的人，在1868年引入了贝塞麦炼钢法（Bessemer process）。在接下来的30年里，我们的钢铁工业大大增加。到1898年，我们已经远远超过了所有的竞争对手。美国的产量约等于英国和德国的总和。我们还大大降低了成本，以至于欧洲谈到了『美国的危险』。那是1898年，JP摩根公司通过组织联邦钢铁公司，迈出了组建钢铁信托公司的第一步。随后，钢管厂被合并为一家价值80,000,000美元的公司，JP摩根公司为他们的银团服务购买了20,000,000美元的普通股。大约在同一时间，桥梁结构工程、锡板、钢板、箍筋和其他工厂也进行了合并；最后，在1901年，钢铁信托公司成立，资本额为14.02亿美元。这些组合是在钢铁工业被『启动』后的30年。
   </p>
   <h2>
   电话
   </h2>
   <p>
   电话业的历史还不到40年。它可能是美国对工业发展的最大贡献。银行家们没有参与『启动』它。荣耀属于马萨诸塞州哈弗希尔的一个质朴、热情、热心的商人，他愿意拿自己的钱冒险。H.N.Casson在他的『电话史』中最有趣地讲述了这一点：
   </p>
   <p>
   『唯一一个有钱、并敢于把它押在电话未来上的人是托马斯 · 桑德斯，他这样做主要不是为了商业原因。他和哈伯德对贝尔的联系主要来自于感情，因为贝尔治好了桑德斯的小儿子的哑巴，而且很快就要娶哈伯德的女儿。另外，桑德斯起初也没有想到会需要这么多钱。他并不富有。他的全部业务（为鞋厂切割鞋底）在任何时候都不超过3.5万美元。然而，从1874年到1878年，他垫付了用于电话的90%的资金。最初的五千部电话（甚至更多）都是用他的资金制作的。在桑德斯得到任何救济之前，漫长而昂贵的几个月过去了，他不得不违背自己的意愿和商业判断，用尽了自己的信用额度，以帮助贝尔已经电话项目。他拼命地在一张又一张的票据上签字，直到他面临着11万美元的总额。如果这个新的『科学玩具』成功了（不过他经常怀疑），他将成为哈弗希尔最富有的公民；如果它失败了，他将成为一个破产者，他自己也非常担心这一点。桑德斯和哈伯德将电话两两租给以前一直使用西联电报公司的私人线路的商人们。这个伟大的公司此时是那些银行家天然的、不可避免的敌人。它已经吞并了大部分竞争对手，并正在伸手垄断所有的有线通信方式。在桑德斯和哈伯德面前最美好的希望是：西部联盟可能会决定购买贝尔的专利，就像它已经购买了许多其他专利一样。在一个灰心丧气的时刻，他们曾以10万美元的价格向西部联盟的总裁奥顿提供电话；而奥顿拒绝了它。他愉快地问道：「这家公司能用一个电子玩具做什么？」
   </p>
   <p>
   但是，除了经营自己的电线，西部联盟还向客户提供各种印刷电报机和拨号电报机，其中一些可以每分钟传送60个字。它认为，这些精确的仪器永远不会被电话这样的科学怪胎所取代，而且它一直这样认为，直到它的一个子公司（黄金和股票公司，Gold and Stock）报告说，它的几台机器已经被电话所取代。
   </p>
   <p>
   『西联公司立即从其冷漠中醒来。即使是这种对其业务的微小蚕食也必须被阻止。它迅速采取了行动，组织了『美国电话公司』（American Speaking-Telephone Company），并拥有30万美元的资本，其员工中有三位电气发明家，即爱迪生、格雷和多尔比。它以其巨大的财富和威望，对贝尔和他的小保镖进行了扫荡。它践踏贝尔的专利，就像大象践踏蚂蚁的巢穴一样毫不在意。在贝尔完全不知所措的情况下，它冷静地宣布它拥有唯一的原始电话，并准备提供具有原始发明者--多尔比、格雷和爱迪生的所有最新改进的高级电话。』
   </p>
   <p>
   『结果很奇怪，出乎意料：贝尔集团非但没有被赶出这个领域，反而一下子被提升到商业世界的更高层次。而西部联盟在保护其私人线路的努力中，不由自主地成为引领资本家走向电话的「风向标」。』
   </p>
   <p>
   即使在那时，当财政援助来到贝尔企业时，也是来自资本家，而不是银行家，在这些资本家中，威廉 · H · 福布斯（伯灵顿号建造者的儿子）成为贝尔电话公司的第一位总裁。那是在1878年。二十多年后，在电话遍布全球之后，摩根大屋开始对该财产进行财务控制。美国电话电报公司（The American Telephone & Telegraph Company）成立了。合并的过程开始活跃起来。自1900年1月以来，其股票已从25,886,300美元增加到344,606,400美元。在六年中（1906年至1912年），摩根合伙人销售了该公司或其子公司的约300,000,000美元的债券。在这一时期，电话公司的业务量当然大大增加，工厂也必须不断增加；但这些巨额证券发行的收益在很大程度上被用于实现联合。也就是说，这些收益也被用于收购电话的竞争者、用于购买西部联合电报公司的控制权、用于购买半独立的贝尔公司的未发行股票权益。正是这些组合导致了司法部对电话公司的调查；它们在很大程度上对政府接管电话业务的运动负责。
   </p>
   <h2>
   电力机械
   </h2>
   <p>
   制造电气机械和仪器的业务只有30多年的历史。JP摩根公司很早就对其中的一个分支感兴趣，但他们今天在这个行业的主导地位不是因为他们『发起』的，而是因为他们在1892年实现了联合，并组织成立了通用电气公司（General Electric Company）。当时有三家大型电气公司，即汤姆森 · 休斯顿公司、爱迪生公司和威斯汀豪斯公司，此外还有一些小型公司。马萨诸塞州林恩的汤姆森 · 休斯顿公司在许多方面都是领导者，它的成立是为了引进伊莱休 · 汤姆森教授和休斯顿教授的重要发明。林恩是美国的主要制鞋中心之一。它离波士顿的州街不到10英里；但汤姆森早期的财政支持不是来自波士顿的银行家，而是主要来自林恩的商人和投资者；这些人积极主动、精力充沛，并习惯于用自己的钱冒险。其中最突出的是鞋子制造商查尔斯 · A · 科芬（Charles A. Coffin），他在汤姆森 · 休斯顿公司成立时就与该公司建立了联系，并在摩根先生于1892年通过合并汤姆森 · 休斯顿公司和爱迪生公司成立通用电气公司时担任总裁。在他的持续服务下，在其他担任高级职务的汤姆森 · 休斯顿人的支持下，该公司的巨大繁荣在很大程度上是由于——如此合并的两家公司控制了当时美国所有电气专利的二分之一；而且肯定超过了那些很值钱专利的一半。
   </p>
   <p>
   1896年，通用电气公司将其专利与西屋公司合并，从而进一步限制了竞争。1903年，通用电气公司吸收了它的另一个大型竞争对手斯坦利电气公司（Stanley Electric Company）；并成为世界上最大的电气设备和机械制造商。1912年，该公司的资源为131,942,144美元。它开出的销售额为89,182,185美元。它直接雇用了超过60,000人，这规模比钢铁信托公司的四分之一还要多。它受到保护，不受『不当』竞争的影响；因为摩根合伙人之一自1909年以来一直是西屋公司的董事；西屋公司是美国唯一一家大型电气机械公司。
   </p>
   <h2>
   汽车
   </h2>
   <p>
   汽车业大约有20年的历史，它现在是美国最繁荣的行业。当帕卡德汽车公司的总裁亨利 · B · 乔伊被问及银行家在多大程度上帮助「启动」了汽车业时，他回答说：
   </p>
   <p>
   『这是可以观察到的历史事实，也是我三十年来作为商人、银行家等的经验，首先是先知先觉地设想了一个机会。他对自己的先见之明有信心，他相信他可以做一些事情，去发展一个企业、建设一个产业、建造一条铁路或者尼亚加拉大瀑布电力公司，并让它获得回报！
   </p>
   <p>
   『现在，人类的衡量标准不是实际的物质建设，而是「使它得到回报」!
   </p>
   <p>
   『有个人在90年代末筹集资金，在密歇根州建造了一个甜菜糖厂。那些自以为聪明者说这是无稽之谈。他从那些愿意和他一起冒险的朋友那里凑齐了钱。他对他自己的能力从来没有任何怀疑，他不仅建造了糖厂，而且还使它盈利。第二年，又有两家糖厂建成，并在财务上获得成功。这些都是由富有的私人建造的。在面对狐疑的银行家和信托公司时，他们抓住了机会。
   </p>
   <p>
   『一旦证明这个行业在财务上是健全的，银行家和信托公司就会借给新的制糖公司，这些公司很快就组织起来了，并提供了很大一部分必要的资金用于建设和运营。
   </p>
   <p>
   『汽车业务也是如此。
   </p>
   <p>
   『当几位先生跟随我对这项业务的可能性进行展望时，银行和更成熟的商人们（他们主要是银行）说：『傻瓜和他们的钱很快就要分开了』……等这样类似的话。
   </p>
   <p>
   『私人资本首先建立了一个行业，支持它渡过难关，在银行不愿意发放任何借款时给予援助，去赢得财务上的成功。
   </p>
   <p>
   『一旦业务被证明是可行的，并且在财务上是成功的，那么银行就会为其需求提供帮助。』
   </p>
   <p>
   这也是汽车业众多财务成功者中最伟大的经验：福特汽车公司（Ford Motor Company）。

   <h2>
   银行家如何阻止发展
   </h2>
   <p>
   但是，大银行家们不仅没有启动工业发展，他们还确定无疑地阻止了发展，因为信托的建立在很大程度上是由于他们的存在。投资者协会在1911年11月致总统的备忘录中作了很重要的叙述：
   </p>
   <p>
   『众所周知，现代贸易组合强烈地倾向于工艺和产品的恒定性，就其本质而言，它们反对由独立发明人创造的新工艺和新产品，因此倾向于限制专利和专利权的开发和销售方面的竞争，并因此倾向于阻止独立的发明思想，对国家造成极大的损害，这对那些宪法所特别鼓励和保护的发明者是不公正的。』
   </p>
   <p>
   更具体的是《工程新闻》的证词：
   </p>
   <p>
   『我们今天在钢铁冶金方面比德国落后了大约五年，我们的钢铁制造商正在引进的这种创新，大多数只是在追随外国人多年前的领先地位。
   </p>
   <p>
   『我们认为，尽管在培训和科学教育方面，美国与德国的工程师相比，确实存在不足之处，但这并不是因为美国工程师的聪明才智或原创性不如欧洲的工程师。产生差距的主要原因是：美国工业中发生的全面合并。一个庞大的组织太过笨拙，无法承担起发展原创理念的任务。由于市场被严密控制，利润因遵循标准方法而确定，那些控制我们的信托机构不愿意为开发任何新事物而伤脑筋。
   </p>
   <p>
   『我们举冶金业的例子只是为了说明问题。还有很多其他工业领域存在着完全相同的情况。我们正在制造与十几年前相同的机器，使用相同的方法，而技术上的真正进步是由欧洲的发明家和制造商取得的。』
   </p>
   <p>
   对此，可以补充威尔逊总统的声明：
   </p>
   <p>
   『我并不是说所有的发明都因托拉斯的发展而停止了，但我认为非常清楚的是，许多领域的发明受到了阻碍，发明者无法充分收获他们的智慧和工业成果，人类被剥夺了许多舒适和便利，以及以较低价格购买的机会。
   </p>
   <p>
   『你是否还有机会了解到？——在这个年代，发明创造并不受待见。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   信托和金融集中化
   </h2>
   <p>
   工业垄断阻止发展的事实甚至比通过敲诈性价格施加的直接负担更严重。但是，托拉斯最有害的事件是它们促进了金融集中。工业信托助长了货币信托。实际上，每一个信托基金都破坏了一些社区和许多财产的财务独立性；因为它把整个业务的大部分资金集中在纽约，而这通常是由几家银行中的一家负责。这一点在钢铁信托中得到了很好的说明，它是信托的信托；也就是说，钢铁信托将以前在钢铁业务的不同分支中形成的信托结合在一个巨大的控股公司中。因此，钢管信托公司结合了17家钢管厂，位于16个不同的城市，分散在5个州，由13家不同的公司拥有；钢丝信托基金结合了19家钢厂；钢板信托基金26家；桥梁和结构信托基金27家；以及锡板信托基金36家；所有这些都同样散布在许多州。最后，这些公司和其他公司组成了美国钢铁公司，总共合并了228家公司，位于127个城镇，散布在18个州。在合并之前，这些公司中的几乎每一家都主要由管理它的人拥有，并且在很大程度上是在它所在的地方或州内融资的。当钢铁信托公司成立时，所有这些公司都在一个管理之下。此后，这228家公司（以及一些后来被收购的公司）的融资都必须通过JP摩根公司进行或征得其同意。
   </p>
   <h2>
   证券交易所事件
   </h2>
   <p>
   信托的组织以另一种方式增加了货币信托的权力。很少有由信托公司组成的独立公司在纽约证券交易所上市；也很少有公司在纽约设有财务办公室。大公司的发起人，其股票将由公众持有，还有投资者，都希望他们的证券在纽约证券交易所上市。根据交易所的规则，除非公司在纽约市有一个转让代理和注册机构，否则任何证券都不能上市。此外，银行家董事制度在很大程度上促进了信托公司在纽约市设立财务办公室。这本身就会导致金融集中。但是，股票的上市以另一种方式增强了货币信托的力量。工业股票一旦上市，经常成为活跃的投机对象；而投机以多种方式间接地滋养了货币信托。它将全国的资金吸引到纽约。纽约的银行家在证券交易所处理贷款，这些贷款是来自其他人的钱（other people's money），证券交易所的成员从佣金中获得大量的钱。比如说。美国钢铁公司有5,084,952股流通中的普通股。但在截至1912年12月31日的五年中，该股票的投机活动如此广泛，以至于每年平均有29,380,888股在交易所售出；或几乎是现有钢铁普通股数量的六倍。除了由经纪人或为经纪人进行的交易，交易所的销售涉及到每卖出一股股票支付25美分的佣金；也就是说，卖家支付12.5美分，买家支付12.5美分。因此，仅来自钢铁公司普通股的佣金每年就能提供平均数百万的收入。钢铁公司的优先股也有很多交易；还有138家其他工业企业，主要是信托公司，在纽约证券交易所上市。
   </p>
   <h2>
   信托的影响
   </h2>
   <p>
   但是，信托作为金融集中的一个因素，其效力还体现在其他方面；特别是通过它们的连带业务。通用电气公司对水电公司的控制有力地说明了这一点，美国公司管理局的一份干练的报告中已经披露了这一点：
   </p>
   <p>
   『通用电气公司的影响程度并没有在其综合资产负债表中完整显示出来。大量的公司通过其子公司和由这些子公司控制的附属公司与它存在联系。由于通用电气公司及其子公司的高管和董事也是许多其他公司的高管或董事，还有一个更广泛的影响范围，这些公司的一些证券由通用电气公司拥有。
   </p>
   <p>
   『通用电气公司首先持有三家证券控股公司的所有普通股：联合电气证券公司、电气证券公司以及电气债券和股票公司。通用电气公司直接并通过这些公司及其官员控制着美国很大一部分的水力资源。
   </p>
   <p>
   ……『通用电气集团的水电公司分布在18个州，这18个州有共计已开发或正在建设商业项目的功率是2,325,757马力，其中，通用电气集团有939,115马力的功率，即40.4%。在任何一个州，通用电气集团的公司所控制的最大功率是在华盛顿。其次是纽约、宾夕法尼亚、加利福尼亚、蒙大拿、爱荷华、俄勒冈和科罗拉多。在表中所示的五个州中，通用电气集团旗下的水电公司控制着超过50%的已开发和在建的商业电力。包括在通用电气集团中的各州的电力百分比从密歇根州的不到2%到宾夕法尼亚州的近80%不等。在科罗拉多州，他们控制了72%；在新罕布什尔州为61%；在俄勒冈州为58%；在华盛顿州为55%。
   </p>
   <p>
   『除了已开发和在建的水力发电公司外，通用电气集团还在表中所示的各州拥有641,600马力的未开发电力。』
   </p>
   <p>
   这种水力控制使通用电气集团能够控制其他公共服务公司。
   </p>
   <p>
   『受通用电气影响的水电公司至少控制了16个城镇的街道铁路，78个城镇的电灯厂，19个城镇的煤气厂，并与其他城镇的电灯和煤气厂有关联。虽然这些社区中的许多都很小（特别是那些只提供照明服务的社区），但其中有几个是这些水电公司运营的州中最重要的。通用电气集团的水电公司拥有、控制或与俄勒冈州的波特兰和塞勒姆、华盛顿州的斯波坎、蒙大瀑布、莫桑比克的圣路易斯、明尼苏达州的维诺纳、威斯康星州的密尔沃基和拉辛、纽约州的埃尔米拉、北卡罗来纳州的阿什维尔和罗利以及其他相对不太重要的城镇的街道铁路紧密相连。拥有或控制照明工厂（电力或天然气）的城镇包括波特兰、塞勒姆、阿斯托利亚和俄勒冈州的其他城镇；贝灵汉和华盛顿州的其他城镇；布特、大瀑布、波兹曼和蒙大拿州的其他城镇；科罗拉多州的利德维尔和科罗拉多斯普林斯；圣路易斯，摩纳哥；密尔沃基和拉辛，威斯康星州；埃尔米拉，纽约州；阿什维尔和罗利，北卡罗来纳州，以及其他相对不重要的城镇：摩纳哥的路易斯；威斯康星州的密尔沃基、拉辛和几个小镇；纽约州的哈德逊和伦斯勒；密歇根州的底特律；北卡罗来纳州的阿什维尔和罗利；事实上，几乎每个社区的一个或多个城镇的水力开发都由该集团控制。 除了受通用电气影响的水电公司所控制的公共服务公司外，其他城市也有许多公共服务公司从通用电气公司控制的或与之相关的水电开发项目中购买电力。科罗拉多州丹佛市的情况就是如此，这一点已经讨论过了。在马里兰州巴尔的摩，通用电气集团的一家水电公司，即宾夕法尼亚州水电公司，向控制该市全部照明和电力业务的联合煤气、电力公司出售20,000马力。纽约州水牛城及附近地区的所有电气化街道铁路系统的运行电力，涉及大约375英里的轨道，是通过尼亚加拉瀑布电力公司的一个子公司提供的。』
   </p>
   <p>
   而通用电气公司通过资助公共服务公司，在没有水电的社区行使类似的影响力：
   </p>
   <p>
   『它或其子公司已经获得了许多没有水电连接的城市的公共服务公司的控制权或利益，并且它通过共同的董事与其他公司有关联......通过美国最大的电力机械和用品制造商的著名官员和董事，水电公司之间的这种巨大的关系网络是非常重要的……
   </p>
   <p>
   『可能这种通过共同的官员和董事与如此众多的强大金融企业的关系，使通用电气公司获得了一种优势，可能使竞争对手处于相应的不利地位。无论这种巨大的财政力量是否被用来对任何竞争对手的水电公司造成特别不利的影响，都不太重要，重要的是这种力量的存在以及它可能在任何时候被这样使用。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   谢尔曼法
   </h2>
   <p>
   如果我们允许它的权力不断增加，货币信托就不能被打破。为了打破货币信托，我们必须从源头上阻止这种权力。工业信托是其最有效的养料之一。那些非法的信托应该被解散。应该防止新的托拉斯的产生。为此，《谢尔曼法》应该得到补充，提供更有效的司法机制，并建立一个具有行政职能的委员会来帮助执行法律。如果这样做了，就会在确保新自由方面又迈出了一步。但仅靠限制性立法是不够的。我们应该牢记公司专员在结束对我们美国水力发展的审查时提出的告诫：
   </p>
   <p>
   『在水力和其他公共事业方面出现了这样一种情况：在任何时候都可能在一个单一的管理下，控制美国大部分已开发的水力，并对大量城市和城镇的公共事业进行类似的控制，包括该国最重要的一些城市和城镇。』
   </p>
   <p>
   我们应该保护联邦政府和各州现在对我们的自然资源所拥有的所有权利，而且应该将我们的工业与铁路和公共事业完全分开。
   </p>
   <h1>
   第八章：巨大的诅咒
   </h1>
   <p>
   庞大的规模是货币信托公司崛起的一个重要因素。大铁路系统、大工业信托、大公共服务公司作为这些大银行家和大信托公司的工具。在JP摩根公司给普约委员会的辩护信中敦促，将大企业的需求作为金融集中的理由。他们宣称，他们委婉地称之为『合作』的东西是『处理大交易的必要性的进一步结果』，『国家显然不仅需要较大的单个银行，而且还要求这些银行合作，以有效地执行国家的业务』，『如果不沿这条路线发展，就意味着工业进步的停顿，这将影响从大西洋到太平洋的每个工薪阶层。』 银行家们使用『大交易』这一短语，显然是指大型企业的安全问题。
   </p>
   <p>
   在过去的15年中，主要的银行家们无疑合作解决了一些非常大的安全问题，以及许多小问题。但相对而言，很少有大型证券发行是由于某些重大改进或工业发展不可或缺所致。改进和发展通常进展缓慢。对他们来说，即使企业涉及大量支出，一系列较小的问题通常比单一的大型问题更合适。这在东部地区尤其如此，那里的新铁路建设实际上已经停止了。银行家们合作的『大型』证券发行，除了相对较少的例外，都是为了实现联合或作为这种联合的结果而进行的。此外，在大多数情况下，使这些大型证券发行或承销成为必要的联合，要么违反了现有的成文法，要么违反了州际商业委员会建议的法律，要么违反了商业效率的法律。因此，无论是金融集中还是它们所服务的组合，主要都是违背公众利益的。我们被告知，规模不是一种犯罪。但是，规模至少会因为其获得的手段或其用途而变得有害。而正是通过组合而不是自然增长获得的规模，在很大程度上促成了我们的金融集中。让我们来看看几个案例。
   </p>
   <h2>
   哈里曼太平洋公司（The Harriman Pacifics）
   </h2>
   <p>
   JP摩根在敦促『需要大型银行和银行家的合作』时说：
   </p>
   <p>
   『总检察长最近批准了联合太平洋公司的解决方案，要求银行家们作出126,000,000美元的单一承诺。』
   </p>
   <p>
   这126,000,000美元的『承诺』并不是为了使联合太平洋公司获得资本。相反，它是一种保证，即它将成功处置其南太平洋公司的股票，达到这一数额。而当它处置了这些股票后，它就面临着一个严重的问题：如何处理这些收益？这种巨大的承销之所以成为必要，完全是因为联合太平洋公司违反了《谢尔曼法》。它非法收购了南太平洋公司的大量股票；美国最高法院最终裁定停止这种非法行为。同样的非法购买是12年前另一项 "大交易 “的契机：发行100,000,000美元的联合太平洋公司债券，这些债券被出售以提供资金用于违法收购南太平洋公司和其他股票。银行家们也『合作』完成了这项工作。
   </p>
   <h2>
   联合太平洋公司的改进
   </h2>
   <p>
   联合太平洋公司及其辅助线路（俄勒冈短线、俄勒冈铁路和航海以及俄勒冈-华盛顿铁路）在截至1912年6月30日的14年中，共发行了375,158,183美元的证券（其中46,500,000美元被退还或赎回）；但大量证券的发行主要用于为从事非法联合或股票投机提供资金。提升联合太平洋铁路公司运营效率的，主要是其铁路运营的净收益。请注意，这些提高效率的工艺改进和基础设施扩建是多么巨大：拉直铁轨，降低坡度，重建桥梁，重铺铁轨，替换旧设备……而这些费用主要是作为运营费用。增加了额外的设备，建造或收购了新的线路，使系统增加了3524英里的线路，还进行了其他改进和改善，并计入资本账户。这些支出总额为191,512,328美元。但它不需要『大型证券发行』来提供如此明智的资本支出。这些铁路运营的净收益是如此之大，以至于几乎所有这些改进和补充都可以在不发行平均每年超过100万美元的『新货币』额外证券的情况下完成，并且该公司在1906年（该利率被采用时）仍然可以支付6%的股息。因为虽然平均每年有13,679,452美元被计入道路和设备成本，但剩余的净收益和其他资金平均每年会产生12,750,982美元，可用于改进和增加，而无需通过发行新的证券筹集资金。
   </p>
   <h2>
   证券收益的使用情况
   </h2>
   <p>
   375,000,000美元的证券（除了改进所需的约13,000,000美元，以及用于退款和赎回的金额）可用于购买其他公司的股票和债券。一些如此收购的股票以高额利润出售，提供了进一步的资金用于购买股票。

   因此，375,000,000美元的联合太平洋公司证券发行并不需要为联合太平洋公司的改进提供资金；这些发行也没有为联合太平洋公司投资的任何公司的改进提供资金，除了后来预支了某些金额以帮助为南太平洋公司融资。它们基本上没有起到任何作用，只是将铁路股票的所有权从一组人转移到另一组人。
   </p>
   <p>
   以下是一些主要的投资：
   </p>
   <p>
   1. 91,657,500美元，用于收购和资助南太平洋公司。
   </p>
   <p>
   2. 89,391,401美元，用于收购北太平洋股票和北方证券公司的股票。
   </p>
   <p>
   3. 45,466,960美元，用于收购巴尔的摩和俄亥俄股票。
   </p>
   <p>
   4. 37,692,256美元，用于收购伊利诺伊中央银行的股票。
   </p>
   <p>
   5. 23,205,679美元，用于收购纽约中央银行的股票。
   </p>
   <p>
   6. 10,395,000美元，用于收购艾奇逊、托皮卡和圣菲公司的股票。
   </p>
   <p>
   7. 8,946,781美元，用于收购芝加哥和阿尔顿的股票。
   </p>
   <p>
   8. 11,610,187美元，用于收购芝加哥、密尔沃基和圣保罗的股票。
   </p>
   <p>
   9. 6,750,423美元，用于收购芝加哥和西北公司的股票。
   </p>
   <p>
   10. 6,936,696美元，用于收购铁路证券公司的股票（伊利诺伊中央银行的股票）。
   </p>
   <p>
   正如州际商业委员会在1907年所说，这些股票收购的直接影响仅仅是这样：
   </p>
   <p>
   『哈里曼先生可以从纽约乘汽船到新奥尔良，然后通过铁路到旧金山，穿越太平洋到中国，并通过另一条路线返回美国，可以通过三条铁路线中的任何一条到奥格登，然后到堪萨斯城或奥马哈，而不必离开他控制的承运人的甲板，也不必重复任何部分的旅程。
   </p>
   <p>
   『他还进一步控制了伊利诺伊中央铁路，从墨西哥湾直接向北延伸到五大湖，与密西西比河平行；在密西西比河以西两千英里，他控制了唯一一条与太平洋海岸平行的铁路，从科罗拉多河到墨西哥边境……
   </p>
   <p>
   『在这次听证会上获得的证词表明，俄勒冈州大约五万平方英里的领土，被俄勒冈短线铁路公司、俄勒冈铁路和航海公司以及南太平洋公司的线路所包围，但没有得到开发。而这些公司可以用于这一目的的资金却被投资于纽约中央铁路公司和其他与联合太平洋系统所在地区只有很小关系的线路等股票。』
   </p>
   <p>
   哈里曼先生成功地成为27家铁路公司的董事，拥有39,354英里的线路；它们从大西洋延伸到太平洋；从大湖区到墨西哥湾。
   </p>
   <h2>
   后果
   </h2>
   <p>
   1909年9月9日，在哈里曼先生首次成为联合太平洋公司的董事后不到12年，他因过度劳累而去世，享年61岁。但是，不仅仅是死亡给他的成就带来了限制。他的多重利益使他无法为他的其他铁路公司提供伟大的服务，而这些服务为他赢得了联合太平洋公司和南太平洋公司的『经理』和『治疗师』的双料声誉。在哈里曼先生去世后的几个月内，伊利诺伊州中央铁路公司的严重设备丑闻公开化，可能最终逼得该公司的一位副总裁自杀。芝加哥和奥尔顿公司（在1899年至1907年期间，哈里曼先生作为总裁、董事会主席或执行委员会成员参与了该公司的管理），从未恢复到他和他的同事们获得控制权之前的繁荣状态。马凯特河畔酒店再次落入接管者的手中。早在哈里曼先生去世前，联合太平洋公司就已经处理了其北太平洋公司的股票，因为美国最高法院宣布北方证券公司是非法的，并撤销了北太平洋与大北方两家公司的合并计划。在他去世三年后，美国最高法院下令撤销联合太平洋-南太平洋合并法案。一个奇怪的讽刺是，法律允许联合太平洋公司从其在北太平洋和南太平洋股票的非法交易中获得大量利润，但许多其他『作为投资』持有的股票却带来了巨大的损失。伊利诺伊州中央公司和其他公司的股票使联合太平洋公司损失了129,894,991.72美元，但在1913年11月15日，其市场价值仅为87,851,500美元；表明缩水了42,043,491.72美元，在持有这些股票时，其平均收入仅相当于其成本的4.30%。
   </p>
   <h2>
   银行家的天堂
   </h2>
   <p>
   Kuhn, Loeb & Co.是联合太平洋银行的银行家。这是为了履行Jacob H. Schiff先生（高级合伙人）自己的的承诺：在重组之前，哈里曼先生于1897年首次成为执行委员会的成员。此后，联合体不断增加，并最终崩溃，股票投机活动也出现了变化。但是，投资银行家们的繁荣程度令人吃惊；金融集中化的趋势没有减弱。银行家和他们的合伙人获得了购买股票的佣金，最高法院认为这些股票是非法获得的，他们还保留了这些佣金。银行家们收到了为筹集资金购买被最高法院认定为非法收购的股票而发行的证券的承销佣金，并保留了这些佣金。当这些公司被违法控制时，银行家们收到了为受控公司的浮动证券支付的佣金。当然，他们也保留了这些佣金。最后，当多年后，一项结束非法组合的法令被颁布时，这些银行家们又在现场提供了承办服务，并因其银行家的帮助而获得了更多的佣金，以使违法公司结束其错误行为并遵守最高法院的法令。然而，在这漫长的时间里，无论是哈里曼先生去世之前还是之后，Kuhn, Loeb & Co.公司的两位合伙人都是联合太平洋公司的董事或执行委员会成员；因此必须被视为与其他人一起对非法行为负责。
   </p>
   <p>
   事实上，这些银行家不仅为已完成的交易承销收取佣金，尽管这些交易是非法的；他们还为同意承销当局不允许完成的『大交易』而收取佣金。J.P.Morgan & Co.提到的『银行家方面的单一承诺』是由『司法部长批准联合太平洋公司的解决方案』要求的。而那项126,000,000美元的承销计划从未生效，因为加利福尼亚公共服务委员会拒绝批准解决方案的条款。但联合太平洋公司还是向Kuhn Loeb辛迪加支付了一大笔承销费，因为他们已经准备好并愿意在机会出现时 "提供服务"：当南太平洋公司的股票在司法部长McReynolds的批准下，根据法院的判决最终分配时，又支付了一笔承销费。因此，非法购买南太平洋公司的股票直接产生了四笔佣金；两笔是在获得股票时，两笔是在处置股票时。而在这期间，非法控制的南太平洋公司为银行家们带来了更多的佣金。因为提交给普约委员会的附表显示，除了上述联合太平洋公司的证券外，Kuhn, Loeb & Co.公司在1903年至1911年间还销售了334,000,000美元的南太平洋和中央太平洋公司的证券。
   </p>
   <p>
   支付给这些银行家的与联合太平洋-南太平洋交易有关的佣金总额没有披露。它肯定是非常大的；因为不仅交易量『很大』，而且佣金也很丰厚。州际商业委员会发现，银行家们在购买首批75万股南太平洋股票时获得了约5%的购买价；而为进行该交易和其他购买而发行的首批1亿美元联合太平洋公司债券的承销佣金为500万美元。联合太平洋公司为实现这一非法合并而支付的这两笔承销佣金有多大，该公司和银行家都拒绝透露。此外，州际商业委员会在调查联合太平洋公司购买芝加哥和奥尔顿的股票时清楚地表明，银行家的利润绝不仅仅限于佣金。
   </p>
   <h2>
   伯灵顿公司
   </h2>
   <p>
   这样的铁路组合对公众造成的伤害远比银行家的佣金和利润的重税更严重。因为几乎在每一个案例中，以前独立的铁路被吸进了一个巨大的系统中，使得一些团体、产权或人丧失了财务独立性，他们因此成为货币信托的主体或附属品。1901年，芝加哥、伯灵顿和昆西铁路公司转给了摩根公司，是这个过程的一个突出例子。
   </p>
   <p>
   联合太平洋公司在1901年收购了南太平洋公司的股票后，也寻求对芝加哥、伯灵顿和昆西公司的控制，这是一条最繁荣的铁路，当时有7912英里的线路。大北方公司和北太平洋公司认识到，联合太平洋公司对伯灵顿铁路的控制将使他们无法进入伊利诺伊州、密苏里州、威斯康星州、堪萨斯州、内布拉斯加州、爱荷华州和南达科他州的大部分地区。这两条北方公路已经与对方和J.P.摩根公司结成了紧密的联盟，因此以215,227,000美元的价格购买了他们联合发行的4%的债券，几乎购买了109,324,000美元（面值）的伯灵顿公司的全部流通股票。随后，与联合太平洋公司进行了一场斗争，但很快屈服于『和谐的合作』。北方证券公司以400,000,000美元的资本金成立，从而兼并了大北方公司、北太平洋公司和伯灵顿公司，并加入了哈里曼、库恩 · 罗布和摩根 · 希尔的利益。显然，无论是发行215,000,000美元的联合4号股票，还是发行400,000,000美元的北方证券股票，都没有为这些『大型交易』所涉及的四大铁路系统中的任何一个提供一分钱的修建或扩建资金。发行615,000,000美元的证券的唯一效果是：将股票从一组人转移到另一组人。由此产生的『和谐合作』很快被政府的程序打断，最终以北方证券公司的解散而告终。但这段兼并的时间里可以去做很多坏事，伯灵顿号已经从其独立的波士顿业主手中永远地转移到了摩根的盟友们手中，他们的盟友依然控制着波灵顿号。
   </p>
   <p>
   约翰 · M · 福布斯所创造的伯灵顿号是波士顿最好的成就之一。福布斯是一个建设者，不是合伙人，也不是银行家，更不是金融奇才。他是一个质朴的、工作卖力的商人。他曾在中国从商，当时与中国的贸易是美国的大生意之一。福布斯曾与航运和制造商有联系。他有大商人的想象力；有大制造商的耐心和毅力；有航海家的勇气；有政治家的开阔视野。他大胆，但从不鲁莽，对别人的钱财一丝不苟，在适当权衡机会之后，他准备在有希望成功的企业中冒自己的风险。从这个词的最佳意义上说，他是一个伟大的冒险家。就这样，福布斯先生在1852年进入了那些后来发展成为芝加哥、伯灵顿和昆西的铁路企业。他主要用自己的钱和信任他的朋友的钱建造了这些铁路，并带着它们度过了57年的恐慌，当时的『大银行』没有勇气去承担这种风险：在资金吃紧的条件下，去建设一条摇摇欲坠的不良路线。
   </p>
   <p>
   在他和他所培养的人的明智管理下，小伯灵顿成为一个伟大的系统。它『建立在光荣之上』、并以光荣的方式管理。它经受住了每一次巨大的财政危机，就像它在1857年所做的那样。它没有经历债务重组，没有牺牲任何一个股东或债券持有人，最终到达成熟期。
   </p>
   <p>
   投资银行家在伯灵顿董事会中没有地位，也没有银行家的做法，即站在交易的两边。福布斯先生在他职业生涯的早期说：『我不愿意冒着被指责为从我有兴趣的公司买东西的风险。』大约20年后，他为把伯灵顿公司从某些『既是承包商、又是董事会成员的人』（contractor-directors）的控制下拯救出来做了最大的努力，他的传记作者皮尔逊先生把这些人描述为「正直的人」，他们认为在他们作为承包商和董事的双重身份下，他们完全能够公正地对待自己。福布斯先生却不这么认为。被他唤醒的股东们站在了他一边，他赢了。
   </p>
   <p>
   福布斯先生是波士顿铁路建设者中的先驱者。他的榜样和他的成功激励了许多其他人，因为波士顿当时并不缺乏建设者，尽管有些人缺乏他的智慧，有些人缺乏他的性格。他的企业和资本在很大程度上建造了联合太平洋铁路、艾奇逊铁路、墨西哥中央铁路、威斯康星中央铁路，以及西部和南部的其他24条铁路。这些西部和南部的铁路一个接一个地脱离了波士顿的控制；其中大部分都进入了摩根盟友的控制。在伯灵顿铁路被交出之前，波士顿已经开始失去对新英格兰铁路的统治权，甚至是失去了统治权。1900年，波士顿和奥尔巴尼铁路被租给了纽约中央铁路，这是摩根的财产；几年后，另一条摩根铁路『纽黑文』获得了对新英格兰地区几乎所有其他运输线的控制权。现在，除了东肯塔基铁路（一条36英里长的线路）之外外，波士顿在西部和南部的铁路统治权已荡然无存；她对马萨诸塞州铁路的控制仅限于拥有19英里线路的格拉夫顿和厄普顿，以及波士顿、雷维尔海滩和林恩——这是一条13英里长的客运公路。
   </p>
   <h2>
   纽黑文垄断
   </h2>
   <p>
   纽黑文垄断公司（New Haven Monopoly）的兴起是另一个引人注目的例子，说明这种联合必然发展为金融集中的状态，它也向你说明了『大型证券发行』的资金最终用到哪里去。
   </p>
   <p>
   1892年，当摩根先生进入纽黑文的董事会时，它是一个非常繁荣的小铁路，资本负债为25,000,000美元，支付10%的股息，运营508英里的线路。到1899年，资本金已经增长到80,477,600美元，但总里程数也增长到2017年（主要通过合并或租赁其他线路）。14年后的1913年，摩根先生去世，梅伦先生辞职，里程数为1997，仅比1899年少20英里；但资本负债增加到42.5935万美元。当然，在这14年中，铁路的业务增长很大；路基得到了改善，修建了桥梁，增加了轨道，并购买了许多设备；为了这一切，需要新的资本；还需要额外增发一些证券，因为公司支付的股息超过了它的收入。但在增加的资本中，超过200,000,000美元被用于收购其他121家铁路、蒸汽船、街道铁路、电灯、煤气和水务公司的股票或其他证券。正是这些外部财产，使得人们热议的6,700万美元6%的债券发行以及其他大型和昂贵的证券发行成为必要。因为在这14年中，包括新设备在内的铁路改进工作平均每年只花费1,000万美元。
   </p>
   <h2>
   纽黑文的银行家们
   </h2>
   <p>
   在纽黑文收购的121家公司中，几乎没有一家公司在被纽黑文吸收之前是由JP摩根公司提供融资的。几代人以来，波士顿和缅因州以及缅因州中央银行（最大的集团）的需求，主要都通过他们自己的股东或通过波士顿的银行机构来满足。没有投资银行家成为这两家公司的董事会成员。纽约、安大略和西部铁路（被收购的第二大铁路）是在纽约融资的，但融资者显然是完全独立于摩根盟友的人。康涅狄格州较小的铁路，现在合并为中央新英格兰公司，主要在康涅狄格州融资，或由独立的纽约银行家融资。街道铁路公司的融资主要是由个人金融家，或由公司运营所在州或城市的小型独立银行家完成的。一些汽船公司由其所有者提供资金，一些则通过独立银行家提供资金。将这121家公司纳入纽黑文系统的结果是，所有这些铁路、汽船公司、街道铁路和其他公司的融资都由J.P.摩根公司负责；独立银行家被淘汰或成为附属机构。执行《谢尔曼法》无疑将导致解散这个庞大的非法组合。
   </p>
   <h2>
   煤炭垄断
   </h2>
   <p>
   乔治 · F · 贝克在雷丁铁路、泽西中央铁路、拉卡万纳铁路、利哈伊铁路、伊利铁路以及纽约、苏斯奎汉纳和西部铁路的董事会中无处不在，这就证明了无烟煤铁路的『合作』，它们共同控制着几乎所有未开采的无烟煤以及实际吨位。这些道路一直是货币信托发展的重要因素。他们被司法部指控从根本上违反了《谢尔曼法》和《赫本法》的商品条款，该条款禁止铁路在州际贸易中运输其直接或间接拥有权益的任何商品。在过去的14年中，这些铁路公司（除伊利铁路公司外）几乎每一次大规模的证券发行都与一些联合行为有关。无烟煤铁路的相关公司联合起来，通过坦普尔钢铁公司压制建造一条竞争性运煤路线，已经被美国最高法院宣布为非法。而在烟煤领域，卡纳瓦区美国巡回上诉法院最近裁定，湖滨公司、切萨皮克和俄亥俄公司以及霍金谷公司的类似联合被解散。
   </p>
   <h2>
   其他铁路公司
   </h2>
   <p>
   联合太平洋公司和纽黑文公司的案例是典型的，而不是例外。在我们的铁路史上，有许多完全或主要是为了实现联合而发行大量证券的例子。这些联合中的一些是合理的，是确保自然支线或干线延伸的一种手段。但更多的是出于压制积极的、或潜在的竞争愿望。它们或出于个人的野心或贪婪，或出于错误的信念，认为效率会随着规模的扩大而增长。
   </p>
   <p>
   因此，现在人们认识到，拥有超过14,000英里线路的洛克岛和圣路易斯和旧金山的超大规模联合显然是低效的。它这是自愿被切断的；但是，如果不是这样的话，即使不是根据《谢尔曼法》进行的诉讼，也一定很快就会因固有的缺陷而崩溃。这两个系统现在都受到了这种不明智的组合的影响；弗里斯科公司本身也被大大地过度合并了，它已经在破产管理中付出了代价。『岩石岛』，这是一个曾经表现出铁路效率和稳定性的名字，却通过过度的资本兼并和重组，成为一只被投机者踢来踢去的足球，并成为那些相信这个项目的投资者产生了忧虑。辛辛那提号、汉密尔顿号和代顿号以及马凯特号的兼并导致了数次破产。
   </p>
   <p>
   当然，还有其他一些组合没有给铁路所有者带来灾难性的后果。但是，一次铁路公司兼并未造成灾难性后果的事实，并不一定能证明它是合理的。权力集中的弊端是显而易见的；由于联合必然涉及到这种权力的集中，为联合辩护的责任应该放在那些试图实现联合的人身上。
   </p>
   <p>
   例如，允许大西洋海岸线铁路公司发行50,000,000美元的证券来收购路易斯维尔和纳什维尔铁路公司的控制权，这对公众有什么好处呢？路易斯维尔和纳什维尔铁路公司是一个广泛延伸、自给自足的系统，长达5,000英里，在收购之前，在总裁米尔顿 · H · 史密斯的英明管理下，该公司已经持续繁荣了很多年；其总收入几乎是大西洋海岸线公司的两倍。最近参议员Lea对这一兼并的合法性提出了质疑；州际商业委员会已下令进行调查。
   </p>
   <h2>
   宾夕法尼亚号
   </h2>
   <p>
   来自宾夕法尼亚州的报告表明，即使是这个普遍管理良好的铁路公司，也会被问及是否受到过度膨胀的影响。1898年后，它也大量购买其他铁路的股票，包括切萨皮克和俄亥俄、巴尔的摩和俄亥俄以及诺福克和西部。1906年，它出售了所有切萨皮克和俄亥俄的股票，以及巴尔的摩和俄亥俄以及诺福克和西部的大部分股份。后来，它改变了策略，重新开始购买股票，除其他外，还收购了更多的诺福克和西部铁路公司以及纽约、纽黑文和哈特福德公司；在1912年12月31日，它持有的证券价值为331,909,154.32美元；但是，其中很大一部分是宾夕法尼亚系统的证券。这些证券（主要是股票）约占宾夕法尼亚铁路公司总资产的三分之一。1912年，这些证券的收入平均只有其估值的4.30%，而宾夕法尼亚州对其股票支付了6%。但持有这些外国股票的成本并不限于这一收入和支出之间的差异。为了筹集这些股票的资金，宾夕法尼亚州不得不发行自己的证券；即使是宾夕法尼亚州的证券也存在着供过于求的情况。任何股票的过度供应都会压低市场价值，并增加宾夕法尼亚州筹集新资金的成本。最近，管理层宣布将出售其在无烟煤矿中的股票，这是值得欢迎的；而且，据说它还将剥离在与铁路业务无关的公司（如坎布里亚钢铁公司）中的其他股份。这一政策应扩大到包括处置不属于宾夕法尼亚系统的其他铁路（如诺福克和西部铁路、南太平洋铁路和纽黑文铁路）的所有股票。
   </p>
   <h2>
   建议
   </h2>
   <p>
   六年前，州际商业委员会在调查了上述联合太平洋公司的交易后，建议通过立法来纠正其中所披露的弊端。在最近结束对纽黑文的调查时，该委员会重申并扩大了这些建议，并说：
   </p>
   <p>
   『研究铁路问题的人都不会怀疑，过去铁路财务灾难和复杂化的一个最多源头是铁路经理人希望并有能力从事其铁路合法经营以外的企业，特别是通过收购其他铁路及其证券。有些恶果在交易发生后是无法纠正的，但它本可以很容易地被禁止，但却最终对投资者（乃至于普通大众）造成的重大伤害。在我们看来，以下主张是所有对州际铁路进行适当监管的基础：
   </p>
   <p>
   1. 每条州际铁路非在合法修建、延伸该铁路的产权时，都应禁止于如下用途：不用在铁路运营方面的花费或债务。
   </p>
   <p>
   2. 未经联邦政府批准，任何州际铁路都不得租赁或购买任何其他铁路，也不得收购任何其他铁路的股票或证券，更不得直接或间接地为其提供担保。
   </p>
   <p>
   3. 除前两段规定的目的外，州际铁路不应发行股票或债券。同时，未经联邦政府批准，不得发行任何证券。
   </p>
   <p>
   试图规定铁路股票和证券的处置价格和方式可能是不明智的；但确定发行股票和证券的目的，并将所获资金的支出限制在该目的范围内，则是简单且安全的。
   </p>
   <p>
   这些建议与全国铁路专员协会通过的建议基本一致。它们应该被制定为法律。并应通过修改《赫本法》的商品条款来补充这些建议，以便：
   </p>
   <p>
   1. 铁路公司将被有效地禁止拥有其产品运输公司的股票。
   </p>
   <p>
   2. 禁止这些公司拥有铁路的重要股份；
   </p>
   <p>
   3. 控股公司将被禁止像雷丁公司那样同时控制铁路和其运输的商品的公司。
   </p>
   <p>
   如果这样的法律得到颁布和适当执行，我们将得到保护，不会再发生像纽黑文事件那样的悲剧，不会再发生像芝加哥和奥尔顿事件那样的国内丑闻，也不会再发生像弗里斯科事件那样的国际事件。我们还将避免因规模过大而导致的效率低下。但更重要的是，通过这种立法，我们将消除金融集中的一个有力因素。分权将开始。被解放的小单位在为自己的需求提供资金方面将不会有任何困难，而不会向财主下跪。在实现新自由的道路上将迈出一大步。

   第九章：银行家管理的失败
   </h1>
   <p>
   从《纽黑文的衰落和梅伦的衰落》（the Decline of the New Haven and the Fall of Mellen）一书中可以得出的寓意不是一个，而是很多。这段历史提供了许多布道的文本，它说明了垄断的弊端、巨大的诅咒、撒谎的徒劳以及违法的陷阱。但是，也许它应该给投资者带来的最深刻的教训是：银行家管理的失败。
   </p>
   <h2>
   银行家的控制
   </h2>
   <p>
   多年来，J.P.摩根公司是纽黑文的财政代理人。多年来，摩根先生是该公司的董事。他对这一财产的关注可能比对他众多利益中的任何其他财产都要密切。股东会议很少是有趣或重要的；摩根先生出席他担任董事的其他公司的股东会议的机会确实很少。但他的习惯是在美国时，出席纽黑文公司的会议。1907年，当垄断性扩张政策首次受到挑战时，以及在1909年的会议上（在马萨诸塞州不明智地批准波士顿和缅因州的合并后），摩根先生亲自提出了大量增加股票的建议，并得到了一致的投票。当然，他出席了重要的董事会议。他的意愿就是法律。梅伦总统在州际商业专员普鲁蒂面前的发言中表明了这一点，他在讨论纽约、威彻斯特和波士顿这条铁路时，在纽约没有一个终点站，纽黑文公司花了150万美元一英里来收购它，而当时在运营赤字和利息费用方面，它每月要花费10万美元：
   </p>
   <p>
   『专员先生，纽约的威斯特彻斯特和波士顿这家公司让我的处境非常尴尬，我从没认为我的这项投资很牛逼而沾沾自喜，虽然其他那些比我自己更有信心的人们，却认为这项投资是明智且可取的，我屈服于我的判断；事实上，我不知道我屈服与否会有多大差别。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   银行家的责任
   </h2>
   <p>
   银行家被认为是社会中的一支保守力量。传统上，他们是『安全和理智』的代表。然而，这条银行家管理的铁路最严重的错误是它的财务鲁莽。这个鲁莽的财务错误已经给整个新英格兰地区成千上万的小投资者带来了极大的损失。银行家应该是他们的天然监护人。在一个其铁路股票几代人都被认为是绝对安全的投资的社区，纽黑文公司和波士顿和缅因州公司在几代人的无间断分红记录之后，其分红的消失是一场灾难。
   </p>
   <p>
   这场灾难主要是由于这些铁路合法经营之外的企业造成的；因为没有一家铁路公司在其外部企业的数量和奢侈程度上能与纽黑文公司相提并论。但必须记住，无论是纽黑文公司的总裁还是任何其他铁路经理，如果没有董事会的批准，都不能从事这种交易。应该承担责任的是董事，而不是梅伦先生。
   </p>
   <p>
   对这些交易的仔细审查没有发现任何正当理由。恰恰相反，仔细检查只会让人更加清楚所犯错误的严重性。在疯狂追求垄断的过程中，不仅进行了不计后果的奢侈收购；而且财务判断、财务工作本身也是明显的错误。为财产支付数倍于其价值的费用、从事极不明智的业务……这些错误是任何保守的董事都不应该犯的；因为董事最重要的职责也许是复核结论，并通过冷静的建议遏制野心勃勃经理们的过度热情。但是，虽然我们没有权利期望银行家在普通的商业事务上有特别好的判断力；但我们确实有权利期望他们审慎、合理的财务管理水平，以及坚持不做假账。但州际商业委员会的严厉批评正是针对纽黑文公司管理层的，批评他们缺乏这些品质。
   </p>
   <p>
   普鲁蒂委员呼吁注意资本化的巨大增长。在1903年7月1日开始的九年中，纽约、纽黑文和哈特福德铁路公司本身的资本从93,000,000美元增加到约417,000,000美元（不包括保险费）。仅仅是这一事实并不能证明管理层有鲁莽的财务行为；但新资本中很少有股票，这很可能引起人们对其保守性的质疑。因为债务（包括担保）增加了20多倍（从约14,000,000美元增加到300,000,000美元），而公众手中的流通股票却没有增加一倍（80,000,000美元增加到158,000,000美元）。尽管如此，在这个大事件频发的时代，即使公司负债的这种增长也可能符合『安全和理智的管理』。
   </p>
   <p>
   这两家铁路公司在这个致命的1913年发现自己面临着最令人不安的浮动债务，对于这些银行家（管理层）的财务判断，我们还能说什么呢？3月31日，纽黑文铁路公司有43,000,000美元的短期票据未偿付，波士顿和缅因铁路公司当时有24,500,000美元未偿付，此后增加到27,000,000美元，其几个附属线路也发行了额外的票据。主要是为了满足其在这些贷款中的份额，纽黑文公司在其大规模扩张之前可以按面值出售3.5%的可转换股票的债券，价格为每股150美元，它如此急切地按面值发行了67,500,000美元的6%的可转换股票的债券。20年期可转换股票的债券，以至于同意支付J.P.摩根公司2.5％的承销佣金。的确，当时资金『紧张』。但对早已预期的『紧缩』货币市场毫无准备，这难道不是非常糟糕的金融行为吗？事实上，纽黑文的管理层尤其应该避免这样的错误，因为它在1907-1908年的『紧缩』货币市场中也犯了类似的错误，当时它不得不按面值出售39,000,000美元的6%的40年期债券。
   </p>
   <p>
   该系统的这些巨额短期借款并不是由于意外的紧急情况或其货币条件造成的。它们是逐渐增长的。1910年6月30日，两家公司的短期票据只欠10,180,364美元；到1911年6月30日，这一数额已经增长到30,759,959美元；到1912年6月30日，增长到45,395,000美元；而在1913年，增长到超过70,000,000美元。当然，贷款的利率也大大增加了。而这些贷款是不必要的，因为那些贷款并没有用于纽黑文铁路或波士顿和缅因州铁路的改建，而是用于支付这些公司所无力购买的其他公司的股票，或者支付尚未赚取的红利。
   </p>
   <p>
   在过去的六年中，纽黑文铁路公司有五年的股息超过了当年的收入；如果对设备和蒸汽船的折旧进行适当的收费，那么所披露的年度赤字会更大。在过去三年中，纽黑文公司对波士顿和缅因州公司拥有绝对控制权，后者支付的股息远远超过了收益，以至于在1913年4月之前，前几年积累的盈余已经转变成了赤字。
   </p>
   <p>
   当然，这些事实至少表明，这在财务上非常不审慎。
   </p>
   <h2>
   为什么银行家的管理失败了
   </h2>
   <p>
   现在，如何解释纽黑文的银行家管理的失败呢？
   </p>
   <p>
   一些人质疑银行家的能力，一些人质疑他们的诚信。专员普鲁蒂（Prouty）将所犯的错误归咎于公司对运输垄断的追求。
   </p>
   <p>
   他说：『原因就像事实本身一样明显。该公司目前的管理层开始时的目的是控制新英格兰的运输设施。在实现这一目的的过程中，它购买了必须拥有的东西，支付了必须支付的东西。这一目的及其企图的实施可以追溯到每一个财务上的不幸和玩忽职守。』
   </p>
   <p>
   但是，我们仍然要找到杰出的银行家（管理层）在进入和执行垄断政策时行使错误判断的原因。因为在执行垄断政策的过程中，存在着与采纳政策同样严重的错误。事实上，正是这些细节上的重要错误的集合，迫使公司先是减少，然后是取消红利，最终损害了公司的信用。
   </p>
   <p>
   纽黑文的银行家（管理层）的失败不能解释为个人的缺点。这次失败不是偶然的，它并不特殊，它是混淆银行家和商人两项职能的自然结果。
   </p>
   <h2>
   一心一意的忠诚
   </h2>
   <p>
   银行家应该与他为之提供银行服务的业务相分离。这种分离是可取的，首先是为了避免利益冲突。银行家董事与他们所资助的公司的关系一直是一个受到批评的话题。他们相互冲突的利益必然会妨碍他们对公司的一心一意的奉献。当一条铁路的银行家董事以铁路人的身份决定发行证券，然后将证券卖给作为银行家的自己，并确定购买证券的价格时，必然存在严重的危险，即铁路的利益可能由于『发行了不应该发行的证券』而受到损害，或者由于『以对公司不利的价格出售证券』而受到损害。因为通常情况下，银行董事们不可能在公司和自己之间作出公正的判断。即使他成功地做到了不偏不倚，这种关系也不会有利于公司的最佳利益。当买方和卖方由不同的人代表时，就能达成最好的交易。
   </p>
   <h2>
   脱离是必要的
   </h2>
   <p>
   但是，反对银行家管理的理由并不完全是立场问题，或者忠诚问题。为了确保铁路公司获得最清晰的财务判断，银行家完全脱离公司是必要的；因为银行家的判断必然会因为参与管理或对实际执行的政策负有最终责任而变得模糊。铁路公司需要的不是财务方面的建议。
   </p>
   <p>
   很久以前，人们就认识到：『一个人如果是自己的律师，他的客户就是一个傻瓜』。其根本原因是，健全的判断力很容易被自我利益所掩盖。同样，建造、购买或经营铁路，或从事工业企业，也不是银行家的职责。银行家的本职工作是判断是否应向其他公司提供信贷，是否应该拒绝从其他公司购买证券，以及向其他客户销售证券。这些职能的正常行使要求银行家必须完全脱离正在处理其信贷或证券业务的企业。他决定给予或不给予信贷，购买或不购买证券，涉及到对管理效率或企业健全性的判断；他不应该占据同一个位置，在这样做时，他只对自己的利益作出判断。当然，超脱并不意味着缺乏知识。银行家应该只在充分了解的情况下行事，就像律师那样：应该只在充分了解的情况下行事。承诺向铁路公司提供贷款或购买证券以出售给其他客户的银行家应该像其法律顾问一样充分了解其事务。但在任何意义上，银行家都不应该是他自己的客户。他不应该以银行家的身份，对自己作为铁路企业的计划或行为的明智性作出判断。
   </p>
   <p>
   银行家的这种超然态度也是基于其他客户的利益要求，比如公司证券的购买者。投资银行家以一种可信赖的姿态站在他的大部分客户面前，这一点应该被充分认识到。小投资者，特别是妇女，她们持有我们公司证券的比例越来越高，通常是根据银行家的建议购买。在大多数情况下，小投资者并不能自己确定事实，从而对证券的健全性作出合适的判断。即使这些投资者得到了这些事实，他们也缺乏形成正确判断所必需的商业经验。这些投资者需要并有权获得银行家的建议，而且显然是他们不带偏见的建议；如果银行家作为公司管理层的一部分，参与了向投资者出售的证券的创造，那么这种建议就不可能是不带偏见的。
   </p>
   <p>
   可以想象，如果大银行摩根没有因为参与纽黑文的管理而使其判断力受到影响，它是否会帮助纽黑文提供如此不明智的数亿资金？
   </p>

   第十章：寡头的效率低下
   </h1>
   <p>
   我们必须打破货币信托，否则货币信托将打破我们。
   </p>
   <p>
   州际商业委员会在其关于纽黑文铁路最近发生的最灾难性的失事的报告中说：
   </p>
   <p>
   『在这个委员会中，有一些人被公众认为是金融艺术的魔术师，也是建造、经营和兼并大型铁路系统的巫师。因此，公众对这些人所拥有的铁路艺术知识感到放心，投资和旅行都应该是安全的。经验表明，公众的这种依赖在资金和安全方面都是不正确的。』
   </p>
   <p>
   银行家管理的这种失败并不令人惊讶。令人惊讶的是，人们本以为它会成功。因为银行家管理违反了人类限制的基本规律。第一，没有人可以为两个主人服务；第二，一个人不可能同时做好很多事情。
   </p>
   <h2>
   看似成功的例子
   </h2>
   <p>
   这些规则有许多表面上的例外；而真正的例外则相对较少。当然，许多由银行家管理的财产是繁荣的；有些是长期的，以公众的利益为代价；有些则较短，因为在由银行家管理之前就已经获得了推动力。如果一个人拥有自己的场地，拥有特权所能给予的一切优势，并且可以『收取所有交通费用』，那么拥有大量的净收入并不困难。即使在竞争性商业中，一个长期建立的、组织良好的、具有广泛善意的企业的成功也必须持续相当长的时间；特别是如果有交织在一起的关系不断给予它比竞争对手更多的优先权。当需要为成功而奋斗时，当自然或法律条件限制了对所售商品或所提供服务的收费时，才是对效率的真正考验。我们的银行家管理的铁路最近就受到了这样的考验，它们没有通过考验。歌德说：『只有在限制范围内工作时，才会显示出主人的身份。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   寡头政治为何失败
   </h2>
   <p>
   银行家管理的失败，部分原因是私人利益破坏了健全的判断力，损害了忠诚度。它失败的部分原因还在于，银行家董事们被他们的职业所引导，在做决定时采用了错误的风险评估方式，甚至往往只是因为他们的位置远离所经营的企业。在银行家董事的头脑中，最突出的是这样一种想法：『我们的行动对公司股票和债券的市场价值、或者对证券交易所的价值，可能会产生什么影响？股票市场是投资银行家生活的一部分，所以他不能不受到这种考虑的影响，无论他是多么无私。股票市场是敏感的。事实往往被社区或投资者误解。而在最好的意图下，容易受到这种影响的董事为了防止误解而做出不明智的决定。因此，银行家董事们经常推迟维护财产的必要开支，或者为了财产的最终利益，因为他们认为现在进行这些开支（通过显示较小的净收益）会给市场造成不好的、甚至错误的印象。由于认为减少或暂停发放股息会对公司证券的市场价值产生影响，所以不应发放的股息也会发放。在困难的商业事务中作出正确的判断，充其量是一种微妙的操作。没有人能够成功地履行这一职能，如果他的思想被转移，无论多么无辜，从研究『长期来看，什么对我担任董事的公司是最好的？』同时担任银行家的董事们由于其职业和环境的原因，特别容易出现这种判断的扭曲。但还有一个原因是，通常情况下，银行家的管理必然失败。
   </p>
   <h2>
   时间因素
   </h2>
   <p>
   银行家由于利益繁多，通常无法付出必要的时间来进行适当的监督，同样也无法获得行使正确判断所需的事实知识。《世纪词典》告诉我们，『董事』是指『引导的人；指导、监督、治理和管理的人』。在任何条件不断变化的业务中，真正的效率最终必须在很大程度上取决于对重要问题的判断是否正确，几乎每天都是如此。而那些主要的银行家们，必然会专注于他们自己庞大的私人业务的问题，怎么可能有时间去了解这么多复杂业务的事实？此外，他们通常在开始时对他们应该指导的特定业务一无所知。当签署创建钢铁信托基金的最后一份文件时，其中一位律师（正如帕金斯先生坦率地告诉我们的那样）说：『这个签名是把钢铁业大规模地交给那些「对它一无所知之人」的最后一个必要的签名。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   寡头们的嗜好
   </h2>
   <p>
   纽黑文系统不是一条铁路，而是一条铁路加上121家独立公司的集合体，这些公司的控制权在纽黑文铁路达到约2,000英里线路的全面发展后被纽黑文收购。在管理铁路和以前通过这122家独立公司管理的每一项财产时，必然时不时地出现一些困难的问题，董事们应该对此作出判断。在纽黑文系统衰落的十年中，纽黑文系统真正的常务董事是J. 皮尔庞特 · 摩根、乔治 · F · 贝克和威廉 · 洛克菲勒。摩根先生在1913年去世之前，一直是世界上最大银行机构的负责人。贝克先生在1909年之前一直是美国一家主要银行（纽约第一国民银行）的总裁和董事会主席，而洛克菲勒先生在1911年之前一直是标准石油公司的总裁。每个人都年事已高。然而，这些人中的每一个，除了自己庞大的业务和重要的私人利益的职责外，还承担了『指导、监督、治理和管理』的职责，不仅是纽黑文，还有以下其他公司，其中一些公司也同样复杂：摩根先生——48家公司，包括40家铁路公司，至少有100家附属公司，16,000英里的线路；3家银行和信托或保险公司；5家工业和公共服务公司。贝克先生——48家公司，包括15家铁路公司，至少有158家子公司；37,400英里的轨道；18家银行和信托或保险公司；15家公共服务公司和工业企业。洛克菲勒先生——37家公司，包括23家铁路公司，至少有117家附属公司，以及26,400英里的线路；5家银行、信托或保险公司；9家公共服务公司和工业企业。
   </p>
   <h2>
   替代者
   </h2>
   <p>
   有人呼吁，鉴于金融业领导人在指导美国商业时承担的沉重负担，我们应该对错误保持耐心，避免批评，以免领导人被阻止继续履行这项公共服务。一份非常受人尊敬的波士顿日报在麦考德专员关于北港失事的报告几天后说：
   </p>
   <p>
   『人们相信，纽黑文的耻辱在某种程度上的重复将使铁路局长的职位变得相当不受欢迎，难以胜任，而且越来越多的负责任的人都会回避。事实上，它甚至可能变成这样，人们将不得不支付一笔可观的薪水，以在某种程度上补偿他们在董事会中的风险。
   </p>
   <p>
   但是，没有必要惊慌。美国人民在商业上对寡头政治的需求和政治上一样少。美国有成千上万的人可以比摩根先生、贝克先生和洛克菲勒先生更好地为纽黑文的股东完成『指导、监督、治理和管理』的任务。因为尽管拥有较少的专业能力，但因为在合适的条件下工作，所以即使是普通的商人也会比他们做得更好。只为一个主人专心致志地服务是一种巨大的力量。有时间对一个企业给予其困难问题所需的关注是一种巨大的力量。还有数以万计的美国人可以被赋予指导我们重要企业的能力。自由是最大的发展。希罗多德告诉我们：当暴君统治时，雅典人并不是比他们的邻居更好的战士；但当他们获得自由时，他们立即超越了所有其他人。如果用工业民主来代替工业专制主义，就不会缺少工业领袖，而工业民主才是真正的民主。
   </p>
   <h2>
   英国的大企业
   </h2>
   <p>
   英国也有大企业。但英国的大企业可以看作是合作批发协会，有一个长达50年的精彩的增长故事。它的年营业额现在约为150,000,000美元，这一金额仅次于少数的美国工业企业，但超过了除宾夕法尼亚州和纽约中央系统以外的任何美国铁路的总收入。它的业务非常多样化，因为它的目的是为了满足其成员的需要。它包括批发商、制造商、种植商、矿工、银行家、保险商和承运人。它经营着全英国最大的面粉厂和最大的鞋厂。它生产羊毛布，各种男装、女装和童装，十几种预制食品，以及同样多的家庭用品。它经营奶油厂。它从事印刷业的每一个分支。它现在正在购买煤田。它在丹麦有一家熏肉厂，在澳大利亚有牛油厂，在锡兰种植茶叶。该协会所做的所有采购都贯穿着这一总原则。无论是在国内还是国外，都要直接到生产源头，以节省中间商和代理商的佣金。因此，它在美国、加拿大、澳大利亚、西班牙、丹麦和瑞典都有买家和仓库。它拥有往返于大陆和英国港口的蒸汽船。它有一个重要的银行部门；它为其成员的财产和人身投保。这些部门中的每一个都是在与英国各自行业中最有效的公司竞争中进行的。合作社批发协会进行采购，并制造其产品，以供应分散在全英格兰的1399个地方分销合作协会；但每个地方协会都可以自由选择是否从批发协会购买；而且只有在合作社批发协会以市场价格出售时才购买。合作社实际上做到了这一点；此外，它还能从其购买的产品中向当地人支付公道的红利。
   </p>
   <h2>
   工业民主
   </h2>
   <p>
   现在，这个伟大企业的董事是如何选择的？不是由英国的主要银行家，或其他被认为拥有非凡智慧的知名人士；而是由所有对该协会的运作感兴趣的人以民主方式选出。直接或间接参与选择英国合作批发协会董事的这些人的数量是275万。因为批发协会的董事是由1399个零售协会的代表投票选出的。而零售协会的代表又是由当地协会的成员选出来的；也就是说，按照一人一票的原则，由消费者选出来的，不论出资多少。请注意，这些工业民主人士选择什么样的人对他们庞大的组织进行行政控制，不是全知全能的银行家或他们的傀儡，而是从同行业实战中崛起的人。通过在地方协会中的突出服务，赢得了他们伙伴的尊重和信任的人。董事的任期只有一年；但董事都在位。J. T. W. Mitchell连续21年担任该协会主席。以这种方式选出32名董事。每个人都把全部时间和注意力放在协会的业务上，而且这32名董事的工资总额比美国公司的许多单一管理人员的工资还要低，因为英国大企业的这些董事每人每年的工资大约为1,500美元。
   </p>
   <p>
   英国合作批发协会是这些机构中最古老和最大的一个。但在其他15个国家也有类似的批发协会。苏格兰协会（威廉-麦克斯韦作为主席最有效地服务了30年，每周的工资不超过38美元）每年的营业额超过5,000万美元。
   </p>
   <h2>
   信托的补救措施
   </h2>
   <p>
   合作联盟秘书长Albert Sonnichsen在1913年4月的《美国评论》中讲述了瑞典批发协会如何遏制了糖业信托；如何粉碎了Margerine联合体（在斗争中损失了230万克朗后迫使其解散）；以及在瑞士，批发协会如何迫使鞋业制造商协会解散的。他还讲述了这个令人难忘的事件：
   </p>
   <p>
   『六年前，在克雷莫纳的一次国际大会上，瑞士代表汉斯 · 穆勒博士提出了一项决议，认为应该建立一个国际批发协会。意大利国务部长、该运动的热心成员Luigi Luzzatti担任主席。在场的人说，卢扎蒂停顿了一下，他的眼睛亮了起来，然后戏剧性地举起手，说："穆勒博士向大会提出了一个伟大的想法——反对大托拉斯，也就是反对世界上的洛克菲勒，建立一个世界性的合作联盟，这个联盟将变得如此强大，以粉碎托拉斯的统治。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   美国的合作
   </h2>
   <p>
   美国没有能够与托拉斯抗衡的批发合作协会，但它有一些非常强大的零售协会，如密歇根州的Tamarack，它在23年内向其成员分配了1,144,000美元红利。最近高额的生活费用极大地刺激了人们对合作社运动的兴趣；约翰 · 格雷厄姆 · 布鲁克斯报告说，我们已经有大约350个地方分配协会。朝向联合的运动正在进展中。在明尼苏达州、威斯康星州和其他西北各州有100多家合作商店，其中许多是由托斯利先生和他的正确关系联盟的伙伴们的热心工作组织起来的，并且在某些方面是附属的。在纽约市，有83个组织与合作联盟有联系。在新泽西州，这些协会已经联合起来成为新泽西州北部的美国合作联盟。在加利福尼亚州，长期以来一直是有效合作工作的所在地，一个中央管理委员会正在发展。而进步的威斯康星州最近明智地立法，在全州范围内发展合作。
   </p>
   <p>
   在我们的农民中，对合作的兴趣特别浓厚。联邦政府刚刚在农业部设立了一个单独的局，以帮助研究、发展和引进农场工作、购买和分配方面的最佳合作方法；现在正在对农场信贷给予特别关注，欧洲大陆在这一合作领域已经取得了完全的成功，美国驻罗马国际农业研究所的代表大卫 · 鲁宾（David Lubin）在这方面做了很多工作，以引导我们注意。
   </p>
   <h2>
   人民储蓄银行
   </h2>
   <p>
   德国农民已经实现了民主银行。13,000个小型合作信贷协会，平均成员约为90人，是真正的民有、民治、民享的银行。
   </p>
   <p>
   首先。银行的资源是人民的。这些资源总计约为5亿美元。其中375,000,000美元是农民的储蓄存款；50,000,000美元是农民的活期存款；6,000,000美元是农民的股本；13,000,000美元是赚取的和放在储备金中的金额。因此，这些大量资源的近十分之九属于农民，也就是属于银行的成员。
   </p>
   <p>
   第二：银行是由人民管理的，也就是由会员管理的。会员资格很容易获得，因为在1909年，每个会员的平均实收股本金额不到5美元。每个成员都有一票，无论他的股票数量或存款数额如何。这些成员选举官员。委员会和受托人（甚至经常是司库）无偿服务：因此，银行的费用平均每年约为150美元。
   </p>
   <p>
   第三：银行是为人民服务的。农民的钱是由农民以低利率（通常是4%到6%）借给农民的；股东在他们的股份上获得与借款人的贷款相同的利率。因此，所有农民的资源都被提供给每个农民，用于生产目的。
   </p>
   <p>
   这种民主的农村银行并不局限于德国。正如亨利 · W · 沃尔夫在其关于合作银行的书中所说：
   </p>
   <p>
   『小规模的人民合作银行以其自身的优点进行宣传，已经遍布德国、意大利、奥地利、匈牙利、瑞士、比利时。俄罗斯正在追赶这些国家；法国正在极力争取拥有合作信贷。塞尔维亚、鲁曼尼亚和保加利亚已经将这种信贷变成了自己的。加拿大已经在获得信贷的道路上取得了第一次成功。塞浦路斯，甚至牙买加，都已经有了他们的第一个开始。爱尔兰在其经济播种方面取得了可观的初步成果。
   </p>
   <p>
   『南非正在摸索着实现同样的目标，埃及已经发现了合作银行的必要性，甚至在克洛默勋爵的宠儿创造的农业银行旁边也是如此。印度已经有了一个充满希望的开始。甚至在遥远的日本和中国，人们也在努力适应舒尔茨 · 德里茨和拉斐森的更完善的组织。整个世界似乎都被一个合作信贷的环所束缚。只有美国和英国仍然可悲地落在后面。』
   </p>
   <h2>
   银行家的储蓄银行
   </h2>
   <p>
   美国的储蓄银行与这些民主银行形成了鲜明的对比。我们的储蓄银行也发挥了巨大的作用。它们为人民的资金提供了有一定收入回报的安全存款。因此，它们鼓励节俭，并为众所周知的意外创造了储备。它们还阻止了『旧库存』的囤积，这种囤积将国家的资金从贸易渠道中转移出去。从某种意义上说，美国的储蓄银行也是人民的银行；因为由它们管理的是人民的钱。2,000家美国储蓄银行的45亿美元存款属于大约1,000万人，他们的平均存款约为450美元。但我们的储蓄银行不是人民的银行，也不是完全意义上的为人民服务的银行。
   </p>
   <p>
   首先。美国储蓄银行不是由人民管理的。在中西部和南部最普遍的股票储蓄银行，是纯粹的商业企业，当然由股东代表管理。东部各州最普遍的互助储蓄银行没有股东；但储户在管理方面没有发言权。这些银行由人民的受托人管理，实际上是一个自我成立和自我延续的机构，由 "领导 "和在很大程度上由热心公益的公民组成。在他们中间（至少在较大的城市），投资银行家和银行董事往往占多数。因此，波士顿最大的三家储蓄银行（其存款总额超过其他18家银行）总共有81名受托人。其中，52人是投资银行家或马萨诸塞州其他银行或信托公司的董事。
   </p>
   <p>
   第二：我们储蓄银行的资金（无论是股票还是纯粹的互助）都不是主要用于人民的。储户可以获得利息（通常为3%至4%）。在互助储蓄银行中，他们最终获得所有的净收益。但是，聚集在这些储蓄所里的钱并没有被用来帮助那些工薪阶层从事生产活动。储户主要是工薪族、受薪者或小商人的家庭成员。从静态上看，这些钱是他们使用的。但从动态上看，这些钱是资本家使用的。因为，储蓄银行的钱被借给存款人阶层中的一个人从事生产活动的情况确实很少。这些人很少能够提供所需的担保；而且，无论如何，他们的小微需求是否会得到考虑，也是值得怀疑的。1912年，波士顿最大的互助储蓄银行Provident Institution for Savings，是美国互助储蓄银行的先驱，管理着53,000,000美元的民众资金。近一半的资金（24,262,072美元）被投资于债券——州、市、铁路、铁路和电话以及银行股票；或者被存入国家银行或信托公司。五分之二的资源（20,764,770美元）用于房地产抵押贷款；平均贷款额为52,569美元。七分之一的资源（7,566,612美元）是以个人担保贷款；每笔贷款的平均金额为54,830美元。显然，『小人物』在借款人中并不显眼；而且这些大规模的投资甚至没有为个人储户提供特别好的服务；因为这家银行支付给储户的利率低于平均水平。甚至我们令人钦佩的邮政储蓄银行系统也主要为资本家提供生产性服务。这些邮政储蓄站实际上仅仅是一个集资站，它收集了人民的钱，以便在国家银行之间分配。
   </p>
   <h2>
   进步
   </h2>
   <p>
   魁北克省Levis的Alphonse Desjardins证明，合作信贷协会至少也适用于一些城市社区。莱维斯位于魁北克市对面的圣劳伦斯河畔，是一个有8,000名居民的城市。德雅尔丹本人就是一个普通居民。多年前，他对人民的储蓄没有主要用于帮助人民生产这一事实印象深刻。当时，在利维斯有三家普通存款银行的分行，分别是：互助储蓄银行、邮政储蓄银行和三家贷款公司；但人民没有得到服务。经过反复思考，他偶然读到了欧洲农村银行的资料。他开始在莱维斯实施这一想法；并于1900年在那里建立了第一个 "信用社"。七年来，他仔细观察了这家小银行的运作情况。在这期间，这个先锋联盟积累了80,000美元的资源。它向其成员提供了2,900笔贷款，总额为35万美元；贷款金额平均为120美元，利率为6.5%。在所有这些时间里，该银行没有遇到过一次损失。然后，德雅尔丹得出结论，民主银行适用于加拿大；他开始建立其他信贷联盟。在过去的5年中，魁北克省的信用社数量已经增加到121家；安大略省也建立了19家。德雅尔丹不仅是先驱者。所有后来的信用社也都是在他的帮助下建立的；现在有24份申请书在手，要求他提供类似的援助。年复一年，这个家大业小、生活简朴的热心公益的人无偿提供了援助，他的生活和普通的机械师一样简单。值得注意的是，这个迅速扩展的合作信贷银行系统在加拿大的建立完全没有得到政府的援助，德雅尔丹免费提供服务，他的旅行费用由寻求他帮助的人支付。
   </p>
   <p>
   1909年，马萨诸塞州在德雅尔丹的指导下，颁布了一项法律，成立了信用联盟。1910年在斯普林菲尔德建立的第一个联盟，是以赫伯特 · 米里克的名字命名的，他是合作金融的坚定倡导者。从那时起，又成立了25个联盟；这些联盟及其官员的名字显示，11人是犹太人，8人是法裔加拿大人，2人是意大利人——这有力地表明，移民对金融民主并非毫无准备。我们有理由相信，这些人民银行将在美国迅速蔓延，并且会取得成功。因为由工薪阶层管理的合作建房和贷款协会，他们联合起来有计划地储蓄和拥有房屋，在许多州都取得了成功。在马萨诸塞州，他们已经存在了35年，他们的成功是显而易见的——1912年的数量是162个，他们的总资产接近7,500万美金。
   </p>
   <p>
   因此，农民、工人和文员正在学习利用他们的小资本和储蓄来互相帮助，而不是把他们的钱交给大银行家保管，让他们自己被剥削。我们是否可以期待，当合作运动在美国发展时，商人和制造商将向农民和工人学习如何通过相互帮助来帮助自己，从而共同实现所有人的新自由？当商人和制造商学会了这一课，金钱帝王就会失去臣民，膨胀的财富可能会缩水；但工业会蓬勃发展，因为人的能力会得到解放和发展。

   路易斯-D-布兰代斯——《别人的钱》
   </p>
   <p>
   1912年，伍德罗-威尔逊在竞选总统时使用了许多关于加强经济的进步思想：银行改革、降低关税以及消除垄断和信托。这些思想的整合被称为 "新自由"。
   </p>
   <p>
   威尔逊当选后，路易斯-布兰代斯（他首先负责威尔逊的许多想法）为《哈珀周刊》撰写了一系列文章，概述了为什么新自由是必要的以及如何最好地实施它。1914年，这些文章被收集成书，并以《别人的钱——银行家如何使用它？》为题出版。
   </p>
   <p>
   布兰代斯的中心论点是，大型银行机构与商人勾结，在美国的主要行业建立信托。信托不仅扼杀了竞争，而且它们变得如此之大，以至于无法有效运作。
   </p>
   <p>
   布兰代斯用事实支持他的论点——从他在纽黑文铁路合并战中与J.P.摩根和查尔斯-梅伦的斗争中以及从普约委员会调查『货币信托』滥用情况的众议院委员会报告中收集到的狡猾事实。
   </p>
   <p>
   威尔逊能够推动通过一些关于商业和信托监管的法律，但在许多方面，由于合并和股票操纵，今天商业世界的条件仍然是一样的。《别人的钱》一书中的许多细节可能已经过时，但它的中心思想仍然是相关的，以至于它在首次出版近90年后仍然在印刷。
